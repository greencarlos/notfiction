<p class="calibre15">The <em class="calibre16">Zohar (zŋhar</em>, “light, splendor”) is a collection of esoteric Hebrew writing, given to the world about 1305 by a learned Spanish Jew, Moses de Leon. It was claimed that the material had been drawn from secret originals, going back to the teachings of Simeon ben Yohai, a rabbi of Galilee in the second century <span><span class="calibre21">A.D</span></span>. Threatened with death by the Romans, Simeon had hidden for twelve years in a cave; ten centuries later his writings had been found there, and these were the sources of the books of the <em class="calibre16">Zohar</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre15">Simeon’s teachings were supposed to have been drawn from the <em class="calibre16">hokmah nistarah</em> or hidden wisdom of Moses, i.e., a body of esoteric lore first studied by Moses in Egypt, the land of his birth, then pondered by him dur ing his forty years in the wilderness (where he received special instruction from an angel), and finally incorporated cryptically in the first four books of the Pentateuch, from which it can be extracted by a proper understanding and manipulation of the mystical number-values of the Hebrew alphabet. Thi s lore and the techniques for rediscovering and utilizing it constitute the cabala.</p>
<p class="calibre15">It is said that the teachings of the cabala (<em class="calibre16">qabbālāh</em>, “received or traditional lore”) were first entrusted by God himself to a special group of angels in Paradise. After Man had been expelled from the Garden, some of these angels communicated the lessons to Adam, thinking to help him back to felicity thereby. From Adam the teaching passed to Noah, and from Noah to Abraham. Abraham let some of it slip from him while he was in Egypt, and that is why this sublime wisdom can now be found in reduced form in the myths and philosophies of the gentiles. Moses first studied it with the priests of Egypt, but the tradition was refreshed in him by the special instructions of his angels.</p>
