<blockquote class="calibre25"><p id="filepos1077439" class="calibre22"><a href="dummy_split_046.html#filepos658684" class="calibre17">11</a> The sense of this advice, which to the Western reader may seem strange, is that the Way of Devotion <em class="calibre16">(bhakti mārga)</em> must begin with things known and loved by the devotee, not remote, unimagineable conceptions. Since the Godhead is immanent in all, He will make Himself known through any object profoundly regarded. Furthermore, it is the Godhead within the devotee that makes it possible for him to discover Godhead in the world without. This mystery is illustrated in Krishna’s double presence during the act of worship.</p></blockquote>
