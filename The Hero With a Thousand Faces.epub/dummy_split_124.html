<blockquote class="calibre25"><p id="filepos926909" class="calibre22"><a href="dummy_split_013.html#filepos149707" class="calibre17">31</a> During Hellenistic times an amalgamation of Hermes and Thoth was effected in the figure of Hermes Trismegistus, “Hermes Thrice Greatest,” who was regarded as the patron and teacher of all the arts, and especially of alchemy. The “hermetically” sealed retort, in which were placed the mystical metals, was regarded as a realm apart—a special region of heightened forces comparable to the mythological realm; and therein the metals underwent strange metamorphoses and transmutations, symbolical of the transfigurations of the soul under the tutelage of the supernatural. Hermes was the master of the ancient mysteries of initiation, and represented that coming-down of divine wisdom into the world which is represented also in the incarnations of divine saviors (see <em class="calibre16">infra</em>, pp. 349-354). (See C. G. Jung, <em class="calibre16">Psychology and Alchemy</em>, part III, “Religious Ideas in Alchemy.” (Orig. 1936.) For the retort, see par. 338. For Hermes Trismegistus, see par. 173 and index, <em class="calibre16">s.v</em>.</p></blockquote>
