<p class="calibre15">Taliesin, “Chief of the Bards of the West,” may have been an actual historical personage of the sixth century <span><span class="calibre21">A.D</span></span>., contemporary with the chieftain who became the “King Arthur” of later romance. The bard’s legend and poems survive in a thirteenth-century manuscript, “The Book of Taliesin,” which is one of the “Four Ancient Books of Wales.” A <em class="calibre16">mabinog</em> (Welsh) is a bard’s apprentice. The term <em class="calibre16">mabinogi</em>, “juvenile instruction,” denotes the traditional material (myths, legends, poems, etc.) taught to a <em class="calibre16">mabinog</em>, and which it was his duty to acquire by heart. <em class="calibre16">Mabinogion</em>, the plural of <em class="calibre16">mabinogi</em>, was the name given by Lady Charlotte Guest to her translation (1838-49) of eleven romances from the “Ancient Books.”</p>
<p class="calibre15">The bardic lore of Wales, like that of Scotland and Ireland, descends from a very old and abundant pagan-Celtic fund of myth. This was transformed and revivified by the Christian missionaries and chroniclers (fifth century and following), who recorded the old stories and sought painstakingly to coordinate them with the Bible. During the tenth century, a brilliant period of romance production, centering primarily in Ireland, converted the inheritance into an important contemporary force. Celtic bards went out to the courts of Christian Europe; Celtic themes were rehearsed by the pagan Scandinavian scalds. A great part of our European fairy lore, as well as the foundation of the Arthurian tradition, traces back to this first great creative period of Occidental romance. (See Gertrude Schoepperle, <em class="calibre16">Tristan and Isolt, A Study of the Sources of the Romance</em>, London and Frankfort a. M., 1913.)</p>
