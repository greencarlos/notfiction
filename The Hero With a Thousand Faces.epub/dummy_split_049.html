<p class="calibre22">T<span><span class="calibre21">HE</span></span> hero of action is the agent of the cycle, continuing into the living moment the impulse that first moved the world. Because our eyes are closed to the paradox of the double focus, we regard the deed as accomplished amid danger and great pain by a vigorous arm, whereas from the other perspective it is, like the archetypal dragon-slaying of Tiamat by Marduk, only a bringing to pass of the inevitable.</p>
<p class="calibre15">The supreme hero, however, is not the one who merely continues the dynamics of the cosmogonic round, but he who reopens the eye—so that through all the comings and goings, delights and agonies of the world panorama, the One Presence will be seen again. This requires a deeper wisdom than the other, and results in a pattern not of action but of significant representation. The symbol of the first is the virtuous sword, of the second, the scepter of dominion, or the book of the law. The characteristic adventure of the first is the winning of the bride—the bride is life. The adventure of the second is the going to the father—the father is the invisible unknown.</p>
<p class="calibre15">Adventures of the second type fit directly into the patterns of religious iconography. Even in a simple folk tale a depth is suddenly sounded when the son of the virgin one day asks of his mother: “Who is my father?” The question touches the problem of man and the invisible. The familiar myth-motifs of the atonement inevitably follow.</p>
<p class="calibre15">The Pueblo hero, Water Jarboy, asked the question of his mother. “ ‘Who is my father?’ he said.’ I don’t know,’ she said. He asked her again, ‘Who is my father?’ but she just kept on crying and did not answer. ‘Where is my father’s home?’ he asked. She could not tell him. ‘Tomorrow I am going to find my father.’— ‘You cannot find your father,’ she said. ? never go with any boy, so there is no place where you can look for your father.’ But the boy said, ? have a father, I know where he is living, I am going to see him.’ The mother did not want him to go, but he wanted to go. So early next morning she fixed a lunch for him, and he went off to the south-east where they called the spring Waiyu powidi, Horse mesa point. He was coming close to that spring, he saw somebody walking a little way from the spring. He went up to him. It was a man. He asked the boy, ‘Where are you going?’— ? am going to see my father,’ he said. ‘Who is your father?’ said the man. ‘Well, my father is living in this spring.’—’You will never find your father.’—’Well, I want to go into the spring, he is living inside it.’—’Who is your father?’ said the man again. ‘Well, I think you are my father,’ said the boy. ‘How do you know I am your father?’ said the man. ‘Well, I know you are my father.’ Then the man just looked at him, to scare him. The boy kept saying, ‘You are my father.’ Pretty soon the man said, ‘Yes, I am your father. I came out of that spring to meet you,’ and he put his arm around the boy’s neck. His father was very glad his boy had come, and he took him down inside the spring.”<a id="filepos695418" href="dummy_split_469.html#filepos1085602" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">28</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">Where the goal of the hero’s effort is the discovery of the unknown father, the basic symbolism remains that of the tests and the self-revealing way. In the above example the test is reduced to the persistent questions and a frightening look. In the earlier tale of the clam wife, the sons were tried with the bamboo knife. We have seen, in our review of the adventure of the hero, to what degrees the severity of the father can go. For the congregation of Jonathan Edwards he became a veritable ogre.</p>
<p class="calibre15">The hero blessed by the father returns to represent the father among men. As teacher (Moses) or as emperor (Huang Ti), his word is law. Since he is now centered in the source, he makes visible the repose and harmony of the central place. He is a reflection of the World Axis from which the concentric circles spread—the World Mountain, the World Tree—he is the perfect microcosmic mirror of the macrocosm. To see him is to perceive the meaning of existence. From his presence boons go out; his word is the wind of life.</p>
<p class="calibre15">But a deterioration may take place in the character of the representative of the father. Such a crisis is described in the Zoroas-trian Persian legend of the Emperor of the Golden Age, Jemshid.</p>
<div class="calibre1"><blockquote class="calibre25"><span class="calibre7">
<p class="calibre22">A11 looked upon the throne, and heard and saw<br class="calibre5"/>Nothing but Jemshid, he alone was King,<br class="calibre5"/>Absorbing every thought; and in their praise<br class="calibre5"/>And adoration of that mortal man,<br class="calibre5"/>Forgot the worship of the great Creator.<br class="calibre5"/>Then proudly he to his nobles spoke,<br class="calibre5"/>Intoxicated with their loud applause,<br class="calibre5"/>“I am unequalled, for to me the earth<br class="calibre5"/>Owes all its science, never did exist<br class="calibre5"/>A sovereignty like mine, beneficent<br class="calibre5"/>And glorious, driving from the populous land<br class="calibre5"/>Disease and want.

</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre9"> </div>
<p class="calibre15">No longer referring the boons of his reign to their transcendent source, the emperor breaks the stereoptic vision which it is his role to sustain. He is no longer the mediator between the two worlds. Man’s perspective flattens to include only the human term of the equation, and the experience of a supernal power immediately fails. The upholding idea of the community is lost. Force is all that binds it. The emperor becomes the tyrant ogre (Herod-Nimrod), the usurper from whom the world is now to be saved.</p>
