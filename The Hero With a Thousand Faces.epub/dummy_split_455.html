<blockquote class="calibre25"><p id="filepos1078807" class="calibre22"><a href="dummy_split_046.html#filepos662229" class="calibre17">14</a> The legendary cycles of medieval Ireland include: <em class="calibre16">(1) The Mythological Cycle</em>, which describes the migrations to the island of prehistoric peoples, their battles, and in particular the deeds of the race of gods known as the Tuatha De Danaan, “Children of the Great Mother, Dana;” <em class="calibre16">(2) The Annals</em> 0/ <em class="calibre16">the Milesians</em>, or semi-historical chronicles of the last arriving race, the sons of Milesuis, founders of the Celtic dynasties that survived until the arrival of the Anglo-Normans under Henry II in the twelfth century; <em class="calibre16">(3) The Ulster Cycle of the Knights of the Red Branch</em>, which treats primarily of the deeds of Cuchulainn (pronounced coohoolinn) at the court of his uncle Conchobar (pronounced conohoor): this cycle greatly influenced the development of the Arthurian tradition, in Wales, Brittany, and England—the court of Conchobar serving as model for that of King Arthur and the deeds of Cuchulainn for those of Arthur’s nephew, Sir Gawain (Gawain was the original hero of many of the adventures later assigned to Lancelot, Perceval, and Galahad); (4<em class="calibre16">) The Cycle of the Fianna:</em> the Fianna were a company of heroic fighters under the captaincy of Finn MacCool (of. note, p. 223, <em class="calibre16">supra);</em> the greatest tale of this cycle being that of the love triangle of Finn, Grianni his bride, and Diarmaid his nephew, many episodes of which come down to us in the celebrated tale of Tristan and Iseult;(5) <em class="calibre16">Legends of the Irish Saints</em>.</p></blockquote>
