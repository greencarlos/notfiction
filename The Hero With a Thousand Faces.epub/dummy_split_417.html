<em class="calibre16">Prose Edda</em>, “Gylfaginning,” IV-VIII (from the translation by Arthur Gilchrist Brodeur, The American Scandinavian Foundation, New York, 1916; by permission of the publishers). See also, <em class="calibre16">Poetic Edda</em>, “Voluspa.”</p></blockquote>
<p class="calibre15">The <em class="calibre16">Poetic Edda</em> is a collection of thirty-four Old Norse poems treating of the pagan Germanic gods and heroes. The poems were composed by a number of singers and potts (scalds) in various parts of the Viking world (one, at least, in Greenland) during the period <span><span class="calibre21">A.D</span></span>. 900-1050. The collection was completed, apparently, in Iceland.</p>
<p class="calibre15">The <em class="calibre16">Prose Edda</em> is a handbook for young poets, written in Iceland by the Christian master-poet and chieftain, Snorri Sturluson (1178-1241). It summarizes the pagan Germanic myths and reviews the rules of scaldic rhetoric.</p>
<p class="calibre15">The mythology documented in these texts reveals an earlier, peasant stratum (associated with the thunderer, Thor), a later, aristocratic stratum (that of Wotan-Othin), and a third, distinctly phallic complex (Nyorth, Freya, and Frey). Bardic influences from Ireland mingle with Classical and Oriental themes in this profoundly brooded yet grotesquely humorous world of symbolic forms.</p>
