<p class="calibre22">T<span><span class="calibre21">HE</span></span> earlier culture hero of the snake body and bull head carried within him from birth the spontaneous creative power of the natural world. That was the meaning of his form. The man hero, on the other hand, must “descend” to re-establish connection with the infrahuman. This is the sense, as we have seen, of the adventure of the hero.</p>
<p class="calibre15">But the makers of legend have seldom rested content to regard the world’s great heroes as mere human beings who broke past the horizons that limited their fellows and returned with such boons as any man with equal faith and courage might have found. On the contrary, the tendency has always been to endow the hero with extraordinary powers from the moment of birth, or even the moment of conception. The whole herolife is shown to have been a pageant of marvels with the great central adventure as its culmination.</p>
<p class="calibre15">This accords with the view that herohood is predestined, rather than simply achieved, and opens the problem of the relationship of biography to character. Jesus, for example, can be regarded as a man who by dint of austerities and meditation attained wisdom; or on the other hand, one may believe that a god descended and took upon himself the enactment of a human career. The first view would lead one to imitate the master literally, in order to break through, in the same way as he, to the transcendent, redemptive experience. But the second states that the hero is rather a symbol to be contemplated than an example to be literally followed. The divine being is a revelation of the omnipotent Self, which dwells within us all. The contemplation of the life thus should be undertaken as a meditation on one’s own immanent divinity, not as a prelude to precise imitation, the lesson being, not “Do thus and be good,” but “Know this and be God.”<a id="filepos639564" href="dummy_split_445.html#filepos1074196" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">4</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">In Part I, “The Adventure of the Hero,” we regarded the redemptive deed from the first standpoint, which may be called the psychological. We now must describe it from the second, where it becomes a symbol of the same metaphysical mystery that it was the deed of the hero himself to rediscover and bring to view. In the present chapter, therefore, we shall consider first the miraculous childhood, by which it is shown that a special manifestation of the immanent divine principle has become incarnate in the world, and then, in succession, the various life roles through which the hero may enact his work of destiny. These vary in magnitude, according to the needs of the time.</p>
<p class="calibre15">Stated in the terms already formulated, the hero’s first task is to experience consciously the antecedent stages of the cosmogonic cycle; to break back through the epochs of emanation. His second, then, is to return from that abyss to the plane of contemporary life, there to serve as a human transformer of demiurgic potentials. Huang Ti had the power to dream: this was his road of descent and return. Väinämöinen’s second or water birth threw him back to an experience of the elemental. In the Tonga tale of the clam wife, the retreat began with the birth of the mother: the brother heroes sprang from an infrahuman womb.</p>
<p class="calibre15">The deeds of the hero in the second part of his personal cycle will be proportionate to the depth of his descent during the first. The sons of the clam wife came up from the animal level; their physical beauty was superlative. Väinämöinen was reborn from the elemental waters and winds; his endowment was to rouse or quell with bardic song the elements of nature and of the human body. Huang Ti sojourned in the kingdom of the spirit; he taught the harmony of the heart. The Buddha broke past even the zone of the creative gods and came back from the void; he announced salvation from the cosmogonic round.</p>
<p class="calibre15">If the deeds of an actual historical figure proclaim him to have been a hero, the builders of his legend will invent for him appropriate adventures in depth. These will be pictured as journeys into miraculous realms, and are to be interpreted as symbolic, on the one hand, of descents into the night-sea of the psyche, and on the other, of the realms or aspects of man’s destiny that are made manifest in the respective lives.</p>
<p class="calibre15">King Sargon of Agade (c. 2550 <span><span class="calibre21">B.C</span></span>.) was born of a lowly mother. His father was unknown. Set adrift in a basket of bulrushes on the waters of the Euphrates, he was discovered by Akki the husbandman, whom he was brought up to serve as gardener. The goddess Ishtar favored the youth. Thus he became, at last, king and emperor, renowned as the living god.</p>
<p class="calibre15">Chandragupta (fourth century <span><span class="calibre21">B.C</span></span>.), the founder of the Hindu Maurya dynasty, was abandoned in an earthen jar at the threshold of a cowshed. A herdsman discovered and fostered the infant. One day when he was playing with his companions a game of High King in the Judgment Seat, little Chandragupta commanded that the worst of the offenders should have their hands and feet cut off; then, at his word, the amputated members immediately returned to place. A passing prince, beholding the miraculous game, bought the child for a thousand harshapanas and at home discovered by physical signs that he was a Maurya.</p>
<p class="calibre15">Pope Gregory the Great (<span><span class="calibre21">A.D.</span></span> 540?- 604) was born of noble twins who at the instigation of the devil had committed incest. His penitent mother set him to sea in a little casket. He was found and fostered by fishermen, and at the age of six was sent to a cloister to be educated as a priest. But he desired the life of a knightly warrior. Entering a boat, he was borne miraculously to the country of his parents, where he won the hand of the queen—who presently proved to be his mother. After discovery of this second incest, Gregory remained seventeen years in penance, chained to a rock in the middle of the sea. The keys to the chains were tossed to the waters, but when at the end of the long period they were discovered in the belly of a fish, this was taken to be a providential sign: the penitent was conducted to Rome, where in due course he was elected Pope.<a id="filepos644501" href="dummy_split_446.html#filepos1075572" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">5</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">Charlemagne (742-814) was persecuted as a child by his elder brothers, and took flight to Saracen Spain. There, under the name of Mainet, he rendered signal services to the king. He converted the king’s daughter to the Christian faith, and the two secretly arranged to marry. After further deeds, the royal youth returned to France, where he overthrew his former persecutors and triumphantly assumed the crown. Then he ruled a hundred years, surrounded by a zodiac of twelve peers. According to all reports, his beard and hair were very long and white.<a id="filepos645213" href="dummy_split_447.html#filepos1076005" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">6</span></sup></a> One day, sitting under his judgment tree, he rendered justice to a snake, and in gratitude the reptile bestowed on him a charm that involved him in a love affair with a woman already dead. This amulet fell into a well at Aix: that is why Aix became the emperor’s favorite residence. After his long wars against the Saracens, Saxons, Slavs, and Northmen, the ageless emperor died; but he sleeps only, to awake in the hour of his country’s need. During the later Middle Ages, he once arose from the dead to participate in a crusade.<a id="filepos645838" href="dummy_split_448.html#filepos1076231" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">7</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">Each of these biographies exhibits the variously rationalized theme of the infant exile and return. This is a prominent feature in all legend, folk tale, and myth. Usually an effort is made to give it some semblance of physical plausibility. However, when the hero in question is a great patriarch, wizard, prophet, or incarnation, the wonders are permitted to develop beyond all bounds.</p>
<p class="calibre15">The popular Hebrew legend of the birth of father Abraham supplies an example of the frankly supernatural infant exile. The event of the birth had been read by Nimrod in the stars, “for this impious king was a cunning astrologer, and it was manifest to him that a man would be born in his day who would rise up against him and triumphantly give the lie to his religion. In his terror at the fate foretold him in the stars, he sent for his princes and governors, and asked them to advise him in the matter. They answered, and said: ‘Our unanimous advice is that thou shouldst build a great house, station a guard at the entrance thereof, and make known in the whole of thy realm that all pregnant women shall repair thither together with their midwives, who are to remain with them when they are delivered. When the days of a woman to be delivered are fulfilled, and the child is born, it shall be the duty of the midwife to kill it, if it be a boy. But if the child be a girl, it shall be kept alive, and the mother shall receive gifts and costly garments, and a herald shall proclaim, “Thus is done unto the woman who bears a daughter!” ‘</p>
<p class="calibre15">“The king was pleased with this counsel, and he had a proclamation published throughout his whole kingdom, summoning all the architects to build a great house for him, sixty ells high and eighty wide. After it was completed, he issued a second proclamation, summoning all pregnant women thither, and there they were to remain until their confinement. Officers were appointed to take the women to the house, and guards were stationed in it and about it, to prevent the women from escaping thence. He furthermore sent midwives to the house, and commanded them to slay the men children at their mothers’ breasts. But if a woman bore a girl, she was to be arrayed in byssus, silk, and embroidered garments, and led forth from the house of detention amid great honors. No less than seventy thousand children were slaughtered thus. Then the angels appeared before God, and spoke, ‘Seest Thou not what he doth, yon sinner and blasphemer, Nimrod son of Canaan, who slays so many innocent babes that have done no harm?’ God answered, and said: ‘Ye holy angels, I know it and I see it, for I neither slumber nor sleep. I behold and I know the secret things and the things that are revealed, and ye shall witness what I will do unto this sinner and blasphemer, for I will turn My hand against him to chastise him.’</p>
<p class="calibre15">“It was about this time that Terah espoused the mother of Abraham and she was with child…. When her time approached, she left the city in great terror and wandered toward the desert, walking along the edge of a valley, until she happened across a cave. She entered this refuge, and on the next day she was seized with the throes, and she gave birth to a son. The whole cave was filled with the light of the child’s countenance as with the splendor of the sun, and the mother rejoiced exceedingly. The babe she bore was our father Abraham.</p>
<p class="calibre15">“His mother lamented, and said to her son: ‘Alas that I bore thee at a time when Nimrod is king. For thy sake seventy thousand men children were slaughtered, and I am seized with terror on account of thee, that he hear of thy existence, and slay thee. Better thou shouldst perish here in this cave than my eye should behold thee dead at my breast.’ She took the garment in which she was clothed, and wrapped it about the boy. Then she aban doned him in the cave, saying, ‘May the Lord be with thee, may He not fail thee nor forsake thee.’</p>
<p class="calibre15">“Thus Abraham was deserted in the cave, without a nurse, and he began to wail. God sent Gabriel down to give him milk to drink, and the angel made it to flow from the little finger of the baby’s right hand, and he sucked it until he was ten days old. Then he arose and walked about, and he left the cave and went along the edge of the valley. When the sun sank, and the stars came forth, he said, ‘These are the gods!’ But the dawn came, and the stars could be seen no longer, and then he said, ? will not pay worship to these, for they are no gods.’ Thereupon the sun came forth, and he spoke, ‘This is my god, him will I extol.’ But again the sun set and he said, ‘He is no god,’ and beholding the moon, he called him his god to whom he would pay divine homage. Then the moon was obscured, and he cried out: ‘This, too, is no god! There is One who sets them all in motion.’”<a id="filepos651353" href="dummy_split_449.html#filepos1076553" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">8</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">The Blackfeet of Montana tell of a young monster-slayer, Kut-o-yis, who was discovered by his foster parents when the old man and woman put a clot of buffalo blood to boil in a pot. “Immediately there came from the pot a noise as of a child crying, as if it were being hurt, burnt, or scalded. They looked in the kettle, and saw there a little boy, and they quickly took it out of the water. They were very much surprised…. Now on the fourth day the child spoke, and said, ‘Lash me in turn to each of these lodge poles, and when I get to the last one, I shall fall out of my lashing and be grown up.’ The old woman did so, and as she lashed him to each lodge pole he could be seen to grow, and finally when they lashed him to the last pole, he was a man.”<a id="filepos652296" href="dummy_split_450.html#filepos1076863" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">9</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">The folk tales commonly support or supplant this theme of the exile with that of the despised one, or the handicapped: the abused youngest son or daughter, the orphan, stepchild, ugly duckling, or the squire of low degree.</p>
<p class="calibre15">A young Pueblo woman, who was helping her mother mix clay for pottery with her foot, felt a splash of mud on her leg but thought no more of it. “After some days the girl felt something was moving in her belly, but she did not think anything about going to have a baby. She did not tell her mother. But it was growing and growing. One day in the morning she was very sick. In the afternoon she got the baby. Then her mother knew (for the first time) that her daughter was going to have a baby. The mother was very angry about it; but after she looked at the baby, she saw it was not like a baby, she saw it was a round thing with two things sticking out, it was a little jar. ‘Where did you get this?’ said her mother. The girl was just crying. About that time the father came in. ‘Never mind, I am very glad she had a baby,’ he said. ‘But it is not a baby,’ said her mother. Then the father went to look at it and saw it was a little water jar. After that he was very fond of that little jar. ‘It is moving,’ he said. Pretty soon that little water jar was growing. In twenty days it was big. It was able to go around with the children, and it could talk. ‘Grandfather, take me outdoors, so I can look around,’ he said. So every morning the grandfather would take him out and he would look at the children, and they were very fond of him and they found out he was a boy, Water Jar boy. They found out from his talking.”<a id="filepos654246" href="dummy_split_451.html#filepos1077159" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">10</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">In sum: the child of destiny has to face a long period of obscurity. This is a time of extreme danger, impediment, or disgrace. He is thrown inward to his own depths or outward to the unknown; either way, what he touches is a darkness unexplored. And this is a zone of unsuspected presences, benign as well as malignant: an angel appears, a helpful animal, a fisherman, a hunter, crone, or peasant. Fostered in the animal school, or, like Siegfried, below ground among the gnomes that nourish the roots of the tree of life, or again, alone in some little room (the story has been told a thousand ways), the young world-apprentice learns the lesson of the seed powers, which reside just beyond the sphere of the measured and the named.</p>
<p class="calibre15">The myths agree that an extraordinary capacity is required to face and survive such experience. The infancies abound in anecdotes of precocious strength, cleverness, and wisdom. Herakles strangled a serpent sent against his cradle by the goddess Hera. Maui of Polynesia snared and slowed the sun—to give his mother time to cook her meals. Abraham, as we have seen, arrived at the knowledge of the One God. Jesus confounded the wise men. The baby Buddha had been left one day beneath the shade of a tree; his nurses suddenly noted that the shadow had not moved all afternoon and that the child was sitting fixed in a yogic trance.</p>
<p class="calibre15">The feats of the beloved Hindu savior, Krishna, during his infant exile among the cowherds of Gokula and Brindaban, constitute a lively cycle. A certain goblin named Putana came in the shape of a beautiful woman, but with poison in her breasts. She entered the house of Yasoda, the foster mother of the child, and made herself very friendly, presently taking the baby in her lap to give it suck. But Krishna drew so hard that he sucked away her life, and she fell dead, reassuming her huge and hideous form. When the foul corpse was cremated, however, it emitted a sweet fragrance; for the divine infant had given the demoness salvation when he had drunk her milk.</p>
<p class="calibre15">Krishna was a mischievous little boy. He liked to spirit away the pots of curds when the milkmaids were asleep. He was forever climbing to eat and spill things placed out of his reach on the high shelves. The girls would call him Butter-thief and complain to Yasoda; but he could always invent a story. One afternoon when he was playing in the yard, his foster parent was warned that he was eating clay. She arrived with a switch, but he had wiped his lips, and denied all knowledge of the matter. She opened the dirty mouth to see, but when she peered inside beheld the whole universe, the “Three Worlds.” She thought: “How silly I am to imagine that my son could be the Lord of the Three Worlds.” Then all was veiled from her again, and the moment passed immediately from her mind. She fondled the little boy and took him home.</p>
<p class="calibre15">The herding folk were accustomed to pay worship to the god Indra, the Hindu counterpart of Zeus, king of heaven and lord of rain. One day when they had made their offering, the lad Krishna said to them: “Indra is no supreme deity, though he be king in heaven; he is afraid of the titans. Furthermore, the rain and prosperity for which you are praying depend on the sun, which draws up the waters and makes them fall again. What can Indra do? Whatever comes to pass is determined by the laws of nature and the spirit.” Then he turned their attention to the nearby woods, streams, and hills, and especially to Mount Govardhan, as more worthy of their honor than the remote master of the air. And so they offered flowers and fruits and sweetmeats to the mountain.</p>
<p class="calibre15">Krishna himself assumed a second form: he took the form of a mountain god and received the offerings of the people, meanwhile remaining in his earlier shape among them, paying worship to the mountain king. The god received the offerings and ate them up.<a id="filepos658684" href="dummy_split_452.html#filepos1077439" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">11</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">Indra was enraged, and sent for the king of the clouds, whom he commanded to pour rain over the people until all should be swept away. A flight of storm clouds drew over the district and began to discharge a deluge; it seemed the end of the world was at hand. But the lad Krishna filled Mount Govardhan with the heat of his inexhaustible energy, lifted it with his little finger, and bid the people take shelter beneath. The rain struck the mountain, hissed, and evaporated. The torrent fell seven days, but not a drop touched the community of herdsmen.</p>
<p class="calibre15">Then the god realized that the opponent must be an incarnation of the Primal Being. When Krishna went out next day to graze the cows, playing music on his flute, the King of Heaven came down on his great white elephant, Airavata, fell on his face at the feet of the smiling lad, and made submission.<a id="filepos659764" href="dummy_split_453.html#filepos1078159" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">12</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">The conclusion of the childhood cycle is the return or recognition of the hero, when, after the long period of obscurity, his true character is revealed. This event may precipitate a considerable crisis; for it amounts to an emergence of powers hitherto excluded from human life. Earlier patterns break to fragments or dissolve; disaster greets the eye. Yet after a moment of apparent havoc, the creative value of the new factor comes to view, and the world takes shape again in unsuspected glory. This theme of crucifixion-resurrection can be illustrated either on the body of the hero himself, or in his effects upon his world. The first alternative we find in the Pueblo story of the water jar.</p>
<p class="calibre15">“The men were going out to hunt rabbits, and Water Jar boy wanted to go. ‘Grandfather, could you take me down to the foot of the mesa, I want to hunt rabbits.’ ‘Poor grandson, you can’t hunt rabbits, you have no legs or arms,’ said the grandfather. But Water Jar boy was very anxious to go. ‘Take me anyway. You are too old and you can’t do anything.’ His mother was crying because her boy had no legs or arms or eyes. But they used to feed him, in his mouth, in the mouth of the jar. So next morning his grandfather took him down to the south on the flat. Then he rolled along, and pretty soon he saw a rabbit track and he followed the track. Pretty soon the rabbit ran out, and he began to chase it. Just before he got to the marsh there was a rock, and he hit himself against it and broke, and a boy jumped up. He was very glad his skin had been broken and that he was a boy, a big boy. He was wearing lots of beads around his neck and turquoise earrings, and a dance kilt and moccasins, and a buckskin shirt.” Catching a number of rabbits, he returned and presented them to his grandfather, who brought him triumphantly home.<a id="filepos661888" href="dummy_split_454.html#filepos1078560" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">13</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">The cosmic energies burning within the vivid Irish warrior Cuchulainn—chief hero of the medieval Ulster Cycle, the so-called “Cycle of the Knights of the Red Branch”<a id="filepos662229" href="dummy_split_455.html#filepos1078807" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">14</span></sup></a>—would suddenly burst like an eruption, both overwhelming himself and smashing everything around. When he was four years old—so the story goes—he set out to test the “boy corps” of his uncle, King Conchobar, at their own sports. Carrying his hurly of brass, ball of silver, throwing javelin, and toy spear, he proceeded to the court city of Emania, where, without so much as a word of permission, he dived right in among the boys—”thrice fifty in number, who were hurling on the green and practicing martial exercises with Conchobar’s son, Follamain, at their head.” The whole field let fly at him. With his fists, forearms, palms, and little shield, he parried the hurlies, balls, and spears that came simultaneously from all directions. Then for the first time in his life he was seized with his battle-frenzy (a bizarre, characteristic transformation later to be known as his “paroxysm” or “distortion”) and before anyone could grasp what was coming to pass, he had laid low fifty of the best. Five more of the boy corps went scuttling past the king, where he sat playing chess with Fergus the Eloquent. Conchobar arose and took a hand in the confusion. But Cuchulainn would not lighten his hand until all the youngsters had been placed under his protection and guarantee.<a id="filepos663677" href="dummy_split_456.html#filepos1080496" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">15</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">Cuchulainn’s first day under arms was the occasion of his full self-manifestation. There was nothing serenely controlled about this performance, nothing of the playful irony that we feel in the deeds of the Hindu Krishna. Rather, the abundance of Cuchulainn’s power was becoming known for the first time to himself, as well as to everybody else. It broke out of the depths of his being, and then had to be dealt with, impromptu and fast.</p>
<p class="calibre15">The happening was again at the court of King Conchobar, the day Cathbad the Druid declared in prophecy of any stripling who that day should assume arms and armature that “the name of such an one would transcend those of all Ireland’s youths besides: his life however would be fleeting short.” Cuchulainn forthwith demanded fighting equipment. Seventeen sets of weapons given him he shattered with his strength, until Conchobar invested him with his own outfit. Then he reduced the chariots to fragments. Only that of the king was strong enough to support his trial.</p>
<p class="calibre15">Cuchulainn commanded Conchobar’s charioteer to drive him past the distant “Look-out Ford,” and they came presently to a remote fortress, the Dun of the Sons of Nechtan, where he cut off the heads of the defenders. He fastened the heads to the sides of the car. On the road back he jumped to the ground and “by sheer running and mere speed” captured two stags of the grandest bulk. With two stones he knocked out of the air two dozen flying swans. And with thongs and other gear he tethered all, both the beasts and the birds, to the chariot.</p>
<p class="calibre15">Levarchan the Prophetess beheld the pageant with alarm as it approached the city and castle of Emania. “The chariot is graced with bleeding heads of his enemies,” she declared, “beautiful white birds he has which in the chariot bear him company, and wild unbroken stags bound and tethered to the same.” “I know that chariot-fighter,” the king said: “even the little boy, my sister’s son, who this very day went to the marches. Surely he will have reddened his hand; and should his fury not be timely met, all Emania’s young men will perish by him.” Very quickly, a method had to be contrived to abate his heat; and one was found. One hundred and fifty women of the castle, and Scandlach their leader at the head of them, “reduced themselves critically to nature’s garb, and without subterfuge of any kind trooped out to meet him.” The little warrior, embarrassed or perhaps overwhelmed by such a display of womanhood, averted his eyes, at which moment he was seized by the men and soused into a vat of cold water. The staves and hoops of the vessel flew asunder. A second vat boiled. The third became only very hot. Thus Cuchulainn was subdued, and the city saved.<a id="filepos666919" href="dummy_split_457.html#filepos1081015" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">16</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">“A beautiful boy indeed was that: seven toes to each foot Cuchulainn had, and to either hand as many fingers; his eyes were bright with seven pupils apiece, each one of which glittered with seven gemlike sparkles. On either cheek he had four moles: a blue, a crimson, a green, and a yellow. Between one ear and the other he had fifty clear-yellow long tresses that were as the yellow wax of bees, or like unto a brooch of the white gold as it glints to the sun unobscured. He wore a green mantle silver-clasped upon his breast and a gold-thread shirt.”<a id="filepos667640" href="dummy_split_458.html#filepos1081310" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">17</span></sup></a> But when he was taken by his paroxysm or distortion “he became a fearsome and multiform and wondrous and hitherto unknown being.” All over him, from his crown to the ground, his flesh and every limb and joint and point and articulation of him quivered. His feet, shins, and knees shifted themselves and were behind him. The frontal sinews of his head were dragged to the back of his neck, where they showed in lumps bigger than the head of a man-child aged one month. “One eye became engulfed in his head so far that ‘tis a question whether a wild heron could have got at it where it lay against his occiput, to drag it out upon the surface of his cheek; the other eye on the contrary protruded suddenly, and of itself so rested upon the cheek. His mouth was twisted awry till it met his ears … flakes of fire streamed from it. The sounding blows of the heart that pounded within him were as the howl of a ban-dog doing his office, or of a lion in the act of charging bears. Among the aerial clouds over his head were visible the virulent pouring showers and sparks of ruddy fire which the seething of his savage wrath caused to mount up above him. His hair became tangled about his head … over the which though a prime apple-tree had been shaken, yet may we surmise that never an apple of them would have reached the ground, but rather that all would have been held impaled each on an individual hair as it bristled on him for fury. His ‘hero’s paroxysm’ projected itself out of his forehead, and showed longer as well as thicker than the whetstone of a first-rate man-at-arms. [And finally:] taller, thicker, more rigid, longer than the mast of a great ship was the perpendicular jet of dusky blood which out of his scalp’s very central point shot upwards and then was scattered to the four cardinal points; whereby was formed a magic mist of gloom resembling the smoky pall that drapes a regal dwelling, what time a king at night fall of a winter’s day draws near to it.”<a id="filepos669781" href="dummy_split_459.html#filepos1081638" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">18</span></sup></a></p>
