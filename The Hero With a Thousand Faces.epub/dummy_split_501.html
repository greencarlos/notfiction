<p class="calibre15">It has been pointed out that the father also can be experienced as a protector and the mother, then, as a temptress. This is the way from Oedipus to Hamlet. “O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams” <em class="calibre16">(Hamlet</em> II. ii). “All neurotics,” writes Dr. Freud, “are either Oedipus or Hamlet.”</p>
<p class="calibre15">And as for the case of the daughter (which is one degree more complicated), the following passage will suffice for the present thumbnail exposition. “I dreamed last night that my father stabbed my mother in the heart. She died. I knew no one blamed him for what he did, although I was crying bitterly. The dream seemed to change, and he and I seemed to be going on a trip together, and I was very happy.” This is the dream of an unmarried young woman of twenty-four (Wood, <em class="calibre16">op. cit.</em>, p. 130).</p>
