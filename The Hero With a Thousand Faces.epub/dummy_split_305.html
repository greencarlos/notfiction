<blockquote class="calibre25"><p id="filepos1014464" class="calibre22"><a href="dummy_split_022.html#filepos367822" class="calibre17">151</a> Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, respectively Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer, constitute a trinity in Hinduism, as three aspects of the operation of the one creative substance. After the seventh century <span><span class="calibre21">B.C</span></span>., Brahma, declining in importance, became merely the creative agent of Vishnu. Thus Hinduism today is divided into two main camps, one devoted primarily to the creator-preserver Vishnu, the other to Shiva, the world-destroyer, who unites the soul to the eternal. But these two are ultimately one. In the present myth, it is through their joint operation that the elixir of life is obtained.</p></blockquote>
