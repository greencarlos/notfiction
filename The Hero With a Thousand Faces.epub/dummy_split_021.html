<p class="calibre22"><span><span class="calibre21">ONE</span></span> of the most powerful and beloved of the Bodhisattvas of the Mahayana Buddhism of Tibet, China, and Japan is the Lotus Bearer, Avalokiteshvara, “The Lord Looking Down in Pity,” so called because he regards with compassion all sentient creatures suffering the evils of existence.<a id="filepos311946" href="dummy_split_238.html#filepos982083" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">83</span></sup></a> To him goes the millionfold-repeated prayer of the prayer wheels and temple gongs of Tibet: <em class="calibre16">Om tnani padme hum</em>, “The jewel is in the lotus.” To him go perhaps more prayers per minute than to any single divinity known to man; for when, during his final life on earth as a human being, he shattered for himself the bounds of the last threshold (which moment opened to him the timelessness of the void beyond the frustrating mirage-enigmas of the named and bounded cosmos), he paused: he made a vow that before entering the void he would bring all creatures without exception to enlightenment; and since then he has permeated the whole texture of existence with the divine grace of his assisting presence, so that the least prayer addressed to him, throughout the vast spiritual empire of the Buddha, is graciously heard. Under differing forms he traverses the ten thousand worlds, and appears in the hour of need and prayer. He reveals himself in human form with two arms, in superhuman forms with four arms, or with six, or twelve, or a thousand, and he holds in one of his left hands the lotus of the world.</p>
<p class="calibre15">Like the Buddha himself, this godlike being is a pattern of the divine state to which the human hero attains who has gone beyond the last terrors of ignorance. “When the envelopment of consciousness has been annihilated, then he becomes free of all fear, beyond the reach of change.”<a id="filepos313529" href="dummy_split_239.html#filepos983518" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">84</span></sup></a> This is the release potential within us all, and which anyone can attain—through herohood; for, as we read: “All things are Buddha-things;”<a id="filepos313772" href="dummy_split_240.html#filepos983818" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">85</span></sup></a> or again (and this is the other way of making the same statement): “All beings are without self.”</p>
<p class="calibre15">The world is filled and illumined by, but does not hold, the Bodhisattva (“he whose being is enlightenment”); rather, it is he who holds the world, the lotus. Pain and pleasure do not enclose him, he encloses them—and with profound repose. And since he is what all of us may be, his presence, his image, the mere naming of him, helps. “He wears a garland of eight thousand rays, in which is seen fully reflected a state of perfect beauty. The color of his body is purple gold. His palms have the mixed color of five hundred lotuses, while each finger tip has eighty-four thousand signet-marks, and each mark eighty-four thousand colors; each color has eighty-four thousand rays which are soft and mild and shine over all things that exist. With these jewel hands he draws and embraces all beings. The halo surrounding his head is studded with five hundred Buddhas, miraculously transformed, each attended by five hundred Bodhisattvas, who are attended, in turn, by numberless gods. And when he puts his feet down to the ground, the flowers of diamonds and jewels that are scattered cover everything in all directions. The color of his face is gold. While in his towering crown of gems stands a Buddha, two hundred and fifty miles high.”<a id="filepos315310" href="dummy_split_241.html#filepos984083" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">86</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">In China and Japan this sublimely gentle Bodhisattva is represented not only in male form, but also as female. Kwan Yin of China, Kwannon of Japan—the Madonna of the Far East—is precisely this benevolent regarder of the world. She will be found in every Buddhist temple of the farthest Orient. She is blessed alike to the simple and to the wise; for behind her vow there lies a profound intuition, world-redeeming, world-sustaining. The pause on the threshold of Nirvana, the resolution to forego until the end of time (which never ends) immersion in the untroubled pool of eternity, represents a realization that the distinction between eternity and time is only apparent—made, perforce, by the rational mind, but dissolved in the perfect knowledge of the mind that has transcended the pairs of opposites. What is understood is that time and eternity are two aspects of the same experience-whole, two planes of the same nondual ineffable; i.e., the jewel of eternity is in the lotus of birth and death: <em class="calibre16">om mani padme hum</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre15">The first wonder to be noted here is the androgynous character of the Bodhisattva: masculine Avalokiteshvara, feminine Kwan Yin. Male-female gods are not uncommon in the world of myth. They emerge always with a certain mystery; for they conduct the mind beyond objective experience into a symbolic realm where duality is left behind. Awonawilona, chief god of the pueblo of Zuni, the maker and container of all, is sometimes spoken of as he, but is actually he-she. The Great Original of the Chinese chronicles, the holy woman T’ai Yuan, combined in her person the masculine Yang and the feminine Yin.<a id="filepos317198" href="dummy_split_242.html#filepos984324" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">87</span></sup></a> The cabalistic teachings of the medieval Jews, as well as the Gnostic Christian writings of the second century, represent the Word Made Flesh as androgynous—which was indeed the state of Adam as he was created, before the female aspect, Eve, was removed into another form. And among the Greeks, not only Hermaphrodite (the child of Hermes and Aphrodite),<a id="filepos317642" href="dummy_split_243.html#filepos985197" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">88</span></sup></a> but Eros too, the divinity of love (the first of the gods, according to Plato),<a id="filepos317804" href="dummy_split_244.html#filepos986266" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">89</span></sup></a> were in sex both female and male.</p>
<p class="calibre15">“So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.”<a id="filepos318114" href="dummy_split_245.html#filepos986462" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">90</span></sup></a> The question may arise in the mind as to the nature of the image of God; but the answer is already given in the text, and is clear enough. “When the Holy One, Blessed be He, created the first man, He created him androgynous.”<a id="filepos318436" href="dummy_split_246.html#filepos986653" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">91</span></sup></a> The removal of the feminine into another form symbolizes the beginning of the fall from perfection into duality; and it was naturally followed by the discovery of the duality of good and evil, exile from the garden where God walks on earth, and thereupon the building of the wall of Paradise, constituted of the “coincidence of opposites,”<a id="filepos318872" href="dummy_split_247.html#filepos986882" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">92</span></sup></a> by which Man (now man and woman) is cut off from not only the vision but even the recollection of the image of God.</p>
<p class="calibre15">This is the Biblical version of a myth known to many lands. It represents one of the basic ways of symbolizing the mystery of creation: the devolvement of eternity into time, the breaking of the one into the two and then the many, as well as the generation of new life through the reconjunction of the two. This image stands at the beginning of the cosmogonie cycle,<a id="filepos319509" href="dummy_split_248.html#filepos987081" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">93</span></sup></a> and with equal propriety at the conclusion of the hero-task, at the moment when the wall of Paradise is dissolved, the divine form found and recollected, and wisdom regained.<a id="filepos319766" href="dummy_split_249.html#filepos987286" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">94</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">Tiresias, the blinded seer, was both male and female: his eyes were closed to the broken forms of the light-world of the pairs of opposites, yet he saw in his own interior darkness the destiny of Oedipus.<a id="filepos320125" href="dummy_split_250.html#filepos987677" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">95</span></sup></a> Shiva appears united in a single body with Shakti, his spouse—he the right side, she the left—in the manifestation known as Ardhanarisha, “The Half-Woman Lord.”<a id="filepos320396" href="dummy_split_251.html#filepos988338" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">96</span></sup></a> The ancestral images of certain African and Melanesian tribes show on one being the breasts of the mother and the beard and penis of the father.<a id="filepos320623" href="dummy_split_252.html#filepos988596" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">97</span></sup></a> And in Australia, about a year following the ordeal of the circumcision, the candidate for full manhood undergoes a second ritual operation—that of subincision (a slitting open of the underside of the penis, to form a permanent cleft into the urethra). The opening is termed the “penis womb.” It is a symbolical male vagina. The hero has become, by virtue of the ceremonial, more than man. <a id="filepos321117" href="dummy_split_253.html#filepos988785" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">98</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">The blood for ceremonial painting and for gluing white bird’s-down to the body is derived by the Australian fathers from their subincision holes. They break open again the old wounds, and let it flow.<a id="filepos321479" href="dummy_split_254.html#filepos989322" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">99</span></sup></a> It symbolizes at once the menstrual blood of the vagina and the semen of the male, as well as urine, water, and male milk. The flowing shows that the old men have the source of life and nourishment within themselves;<a id="filepos321778" href="dummy_split_255.html#filepos989551" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">100</span></sup></a> i.e., that they and the inexhaustible world fountain are the same.<a id="filepos321929" href="dummy_split_256.html#filepos989748" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">101</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">The call of the Great Father Snake was alarming to the child; the mother was protection. But the father came. He was the guide and initiator into the mysteries of the unknown. As the original intruder into the paradise of the infant with its mother, the father is the archetypal enemy; hence, throughout life all enemies are symbolical (to the unconscious) of the father. “Whatever is killed becomes the father.”<a id="filepos322512" href="dummy_split_257.html#filepos990878" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">102</span></sup></a> Hence the veneration in headhunting communities (in New Guinea, for example) of the heads brought home from vendetta raids.<a id="filepos322720" href="dummy_split_258.html#filepos991116" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">103</span></sup></a> Hence, too, the irresistible compulsion to make war: the impulse to destroy the father is continually transforming itself into public violence. The old men of the immediate community or race protect themselves from their growing sons by the psychological magic of their totem ceremonials. They enact the ogre father, and then reveal themselves to be the feeding mother too. A new and larger paradise is thus established. But this paradise does not include the traditional enemy tribes, or races, against whom aggression is still systematically projected. All of the “good” father-mother content is saved for home, while the “bad” is flung abroad and about: “for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?”<a id="filepos323597" href="dummy_split_259.html#filepos991320" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">104</span></sup></a> “And slacken not in following up the enemy: if ye are suffering hardships, they are suffering similar hardships; but ye have hope from Allah, while they have none.”<a id="filepos323860" href="dummy_split_260.html#filepos991514" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">105</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">Totem, tribal, racial, and aggressively missionizing cults represent only partial solutions of the psychological problem of subduing hate by love; they only partially initiate. Ego is not annihilated in them; rather, it is enlarged; instead of thinking only of himself, the individual becomes dedicated to the whole of <em class="calibre16">his</em> society. The rest of the world meanwhile (that is to say, by far the greater portion of mankind) is left outside the sphere of his sympathy and protection because outside the sphere of the protection of his god. And there takes place, then, that dramatic divorce of the two principles of love and hate which the pages of history so bountifully illustrate. Instead of clearing his own heart the zealot tries to clear the world. The laws of the City of God are applied only to his in-group (tribe, church, nation, class, or what not) while the fire of a perpetual holy war is hurled (with good conscience, and indeed a sense of pious service) against whatever uncircumcised, barbarian, heathen, “native,” or alien people happens to occupy the position of neighbor.<a id="filepos325125" href="dummy_split_261.html#filepos991704" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">106</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">The world is full of the resultant mutually contending bands: totem-, flag-, and party-worshipers. Even the so-called Christian nations—which are supposed to be following a “World” Re-decmer—are better known to history for their colonial barbarity and internecine strife than for any practical display of that unconditioned love, synonymous with the effective conquest of ego, ego’s world, and ego’s tribal god, which was taught by their professed supreme Lord: “I say unto you, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you. Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you. And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not to take thy coat also. Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again. And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise. For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them. And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same. And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again. But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil. Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.”<a id="filepos326846" href="dummy_split_262.html#filepos992133" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">107</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">Once we have broken free of the prejudices of our own pro-vincially limited ecclesiastical, tribal, or national rendition of the world archetypes, it becomes possible to understand that the supreme initiation is not that of the local motherly fathers, who then project aggression onto the neighbors for their own defense. The good news, which the World Redeemer brings and which so many have been glad to hear, zealous to preach, but reluctant, apparently, to demonstrate, is that God is love, that He can be, and is to be, loved, and that all without exception are his children.<a id="filepos327582" href="dummy_split_263.html#filepos994027" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">108</span></sup></a> Such comparatively trivial matters as the remaining details of the credo, the techniques of worship, and devices of episcopal organization (which have so absorbed the interest of Occidental theologians that they are today seriously discussed as the principal questions of religion),<a id="filepos327949" href="dummy_split_264.html#filepos994629" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">109</span></sup></a> are merely pedantic snares, unless kept ancillary to the major teaching. Indeed, where not so kept, they have a regressive effect: they reduce the father image back again to the dimensions of the totem. And this, of course, is what has happened throughout the Christian world. One would think that we had been called upon to decide or to know whom, of all of us, the Father prefers. Whereas, the teaching is much less flattering: “Judge not, that ye be not judged.”<a id="filepos328513" href="dummy_split_265.html#filepos995842" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">110</span></sup></a> The World Savior’s cross, in spite of the behavior of its professed priests, is a vastly more democratic symbol than the local flag.<a id="filepos328737" href="dummy_split_266.html#filepos996033" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">111</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">The understanding of the final—and critical—implications of the world-redemptive words and symbols of the tradition of Christendom has been so disarranged, during the tumultuous centuries that have elapsed since St. Augustine’s declaration of the holy war of the <em class="calibre16">Civitas Dei</em> against the <em class="calibre16">Civitas Diaboli</em>, that the modern thinker wishing to know the meaning of a world religion (i.e., of a doctrine of universal love) must turn his mind to the other great (and much older) universal communion: that of the Buddha, where the primary word still is peace—peace to all beings.<a id="filepos329510" href="dummy_split_267.html#filepos996429" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">112</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">The following Tibetan verses, for example, from two hymns of the poet-saint Milarepa, were composed about the time that Pope Urban II was preaching the First Crusade:</p>

<p class="calibre15">Peace is at the heart of all because Avalokiteshvara-Kwannon, the mighty Bodhisattva, Boundless Love, includes, regards, and dwells within (without exception) every sentient being. The perfection of the delicate wings of an insect, broken in the passage of time, he regards—and he himself is both their perfection and their disintegration. The perennial agony of man, self-torturing, deluded, tangled in the net of his own tenuous delirium, frustrated, yet havin within himself, undiscovered, absolutely unutilized, the sect of release: this too he regards-and is. Serene above man, the mgels; below man, the demons and unhappy dead: these all a e drawn to the Bodhisattva by the rays of his jewel hands, and they are he, as he is they. The bounded, shackled centers of consciousness, myriadfold, on every plane of existence (not only in this present universe, limited by the Milky Way, but beyond, into the reaches of space), galaxy beyond galaxy, world beyond world of universes, coming into being out of the timeless pool of the void, bursting into life, and like a bubble therewith vanishing: time and time again: lives by the multitude: all suffering: each bounded in the tenuous, tight circle of itself—lashing, killing, hating, and desiring peace beyond victory: these all are the children, the mad figures of the transitory yet inexhaustible, long world dream of the All-Regarding, whose essence is the essence of Emptiness: “The Lord Looking Down in Pity.”</p>
<p class="calibre15">But the name means also: “The Lord Who is Seen Within.”<a id="filepos332847" href="dummy_split_269.html#filepos998780" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">115</span></sup></a> We are all reflexes of the image of the Bodhisattva. The sufferer within us is that divine being. We and that protecting father are one. This is the redeeming insight. That protecting father is every man we meet. And so it must be known that, though this ignorant, limited, self-defending, suffering body may regard itself as threatened by some other—the enemy—that one too is the God. The ogre breaks us, but the hero, the fit candidate, undergoes the initiation “like a man;” and behold, it was the father: we in Him and He in us.<a id="filepos333492" href="dummy_split_270.html#filepos999406" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">116</span></sup></a> The dear, protecting mother of our body could not defend us from the Great Father Serpent; the mortal, tangible body that she gave us was delivered into his frightening power. But death was not the end. New life, new birth, new knowledge of existence (so that we live not in this physique only, but in all bodies, all physiques of the world, as the Bodhisattva) was given us. That father was himself the womb, the mother, of a second birth.<a id="filepos334017" href="dummy_split_271.html#filepos1000305" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">117</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">This is the meaning of the image of the bisexual god. He is the mystery of the theme of initiation. We are taken from the mother, chewed into fragments and assimilated to the world-annihilating body of the ogre for whom all the precious forms and beings are only the courses of a feast; but then, miraculously reborn, we are more than we were. If the God is a tribal, racial, national, or sectarian archetvpe, we are the warriors of his cause; but if he is a lord of the universe itself, we then go forth as knowers to whom <em class="calibre16">all</em> men are brothers. And in either case, the childhood parent images and ideas of “good” and “evil” have been surpassed. We no longer desire and fear; we are what was desired and feared. All the gods, Bodhisattvas, and Buddhas have been subsumed in us, as in the halo of the mighty holder of the lotus of the world.</p>
<p class="calibre15">“Come,” therefore, “and let us return unto the Lord: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up. After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight. Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.”<a id="filepos335572" href="dummy_split_272.html#filepos1000687" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">118</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">This is the sense of the first wonder of the Bodhisattva: the androgynous character of the presence. Therewith the two apparently opposite mythological adventures come together: the Meeting with the Goddess, and the Atonement with the Father. For in the first the initiate learns that male and female are (as phrased in the <em class="calibre16">Brihadaranyaka Upanishad)</em> “two halves of a split pea”;<a id="filepos336130" href="dummy_split_273.html#filepos1000878" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">119</span></sup></a> whereas in the second, the Father is found to be antecedent to the division of sex: the pronoun “He” was a manner of speech, the myth of Sonship a guiding line to be erased. And in both cases it is found (or rather, recollected) that the hero himself is that which he had come to find.</p>
<p class="calibre15">The second wonder to be noted in the Bodhisattva myth is its annihilation of the distinction between life and release-from-life—which is symbolized (as we have observed) in the Bodhisattva’s renunciation of Nirvana. Briefly, Nirvana means “the Extinguishing of the Threefold Fire of Desire, Hostility, and Delusion.”<a id="filepos336931" href="dummy_split_274.html#filepos1001127" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">120</span></sup></a> As the reader will recall: in the legend of the Temptation under the Bo Tree <em class="calibre16">(supra</em>, pp. 31-32) the antagonist of the Future Buddha was Kama-Mara, literally “Desire—Hostility,” or “Love and Death,” the magician of Delusion. He was a personification of the Threefold Fire and of the difficulties of the last test, a final threshold guardian to be passed by the universal hero on his supreme adventure to Nirvana. Having subdued within himself to the critical point of the ultimate ember the Threefold Fire, which is the moving power of the universe, the Savior beheld reflected, as in a mirror all around him, the last projected fantasies of his primitive physical will to live like other human beings—the will to live according to the normal motives of desire and hostility, in a delusory ambient of phenomenal causes, ends, and means. He was assailed by the last fury of the disregarded flesh. And this was the moment on which all depended; for from one coal could arise again the whole conflagration.</p>
<p class="calibre15">This greatly celebrated legend affords an excellent example of the close relationship maintained in the Orient between myth, psychology, and metaphysics. The vivid personifications prepare the intellect for the doctrine of the interdependence of the inner and the outer worlds. No doubt the reader has been struck by a certain resemblance of this ancient mythological doctrine of the dynamics of the psyche to the teachings of the modern Freudian school. According to the latter, the life-wish <em class="calibre16">(eros</em> or <em class="calibre16">libido</em>, corresponding to the Buddhist <em class="calibre16">Kama</em>, “desire”) and the death-wish <em class="calibre16">(thanatos</em> or <em class="calibre16">destrudo</em>, which is identical with the Buddhist <em class="calibre16">Mara</em>, “hostility or death”) are the two drives that not only move the individual from within but also animate for him the surrounding world.<a id="filepos339000" href="dummy_split_275.html#filepos1002204" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">121</span></sup></a> Moreover, the unconsciously grounded delusions from which desires and hostilities arise are in both systems dispelled by psychological analysis (Sanskrit: <em class="calibre16">viveka)</em> and illumination (Sanskrit: <em class="calibre16">vidyā)</em>. Yet the aims of the two teachings—the traditional and the modern—are not exactly the same.</p>
<p class="calibre15">Psychoanalysis is a technique to cure excessively suffering individuals of the unconsciously misdirected desires and hostilities that weave around them their private webs of unreal terrors and ambivalent attractions; the patient released from these finds himself able to participate with comparative satisfaction in the more realistic fears, hostilities, erotic and religious practices, business enterprises, wars, pastimes, and household tasks offered to him by his particular culture. But for the one who has deliberately undertaken the difficult and dangerous journey beyond the village compound, these interests, too, are to be regarded as based on error. Therefore the aim of the religious teaching is not to cure the individual back again to the general delusion, but to detach him from delusion altogether; and this not by readjusting the desire <em class="calibre16">(eros)</em> and hostility <em class="calibre16">(thanatos)—</em>for that would only originate a new context of delusion—but by <em class="calibre16">extinguishing</em> the impulses to the very root, according to the method of the celebrated Buddhist Eightfold Path:</p>
<div class="calibre1"><blockquote class="calibre25"><span class="calibre7">
<p class="calibre15">Right Belief, Right Intentions,</p>
<p class="calibre15">Right Speech, Right Actions,</p>
<p class="calibre15">Right Livelihood, Right Endeavoring,</p>
<p class="calibre15">Right Mindfulness, Right Concentration.</p>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre9"> </div>
<p class="calibre22">With the final “extirpation of delusion, desire, and hostility” (Nirvana) the mind knows that it is not what it thought: thought goes. The mind rests in its true state. And here it may dwell until the body drops away.</p>
<div class="calibre1"><blockquote class="calibre25"><span class="calibre7">
<blockquote class="calibre25"><p class="calibre36"><span class="calibre3"><em class="calibre16">Stars, darkness, a lamp, a phantom, dew, a bubble, A dream, a flash of lightning, and a cloud:</em></span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre25"><p class="calibre36"><span class="calibre3"><span>Thus we should look upon all that was made.<a id="filepos341789" href="dummy_split_276.html#filepos1002585" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre37"><span class="calibre7">122</span></sup></a></span></span></p></blockquote>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre9"> </div>
<p class="calibre15">The Bodhisattva, however, does not abandon life. Turning his regard from the inner sphere of thought-transcending truth (which can be described only as “emptiness,” since it surpasses speech) outward again to the phenomenal world, he perceives without the same ocean of being that he found within. “Form is emptiness, emptiness indeed is form. Emptiness is not different from form, form is not different from emptiness. What is form, that is emptiness; what is emptiness, that is form. And the same applies to perception, name, conception, and knowledge.”<a id="filepos342607" href="dummy_split_277.html#filepos1002859" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">123</span></sup></a> Having surpassed the delusions of his formerly self-assertive, self-defensive, self-concerned ego, he knows without and within the same repose. What he beholds without is the visual aspect of the magnitudinous, thought-transcending emptiness on which his own experiences of ego, form, perceptions, speech, conceptions, and knowledge ride. And he is filled with compassion for the self-terrorized beings who live in fright of their own nightmare. He rises, returns to them, and dwells with them as an egoless center, through whom the principle of emptiness is made manifest in its own simplicity. And this is his great “compassionate act;” for by it the truth is revealed that in the understanding of one in whom the Threefold Fire of Desire, Hostility, and Delusion is dead, this world is Nirvana. “Gift waves” go out from such a one for the liberation of us all. “This our worldly life is an activity of Nirvana itself, not the slightest distinction exists between them.”<a id="filepos343706" href="dummy_split_278.html#filepos1003103" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">124</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">And so it may be said that the modern therapeutic goal of the cure back to life is attained through the ancient religious discipline, after all; only the circle traveled by the Bodhisattva is a large one; and the departure from the world is regarded not as a fault, but as the first step into that noble path at the remotest turn of which illumination is to be won concerning the deep emptiness of the universal round. Such an ideal is well known, also, to Hinduism: the one freed in life <em class="calibre16">(jīvan mukta)</em>, desireless, compassionate, and wise, “with the heart concentrated by yoga, viewing all things with equal regard, beholds himself in all beings and all beings in himself. In whatever way he leads his life, that one lives in God.”<a id="filepos344625" href="dummy_split_279.html#filepos1004021" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">125</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">The story is told of a Confucian scholar who besought the twenty-eighth Buddhist patriarch, Bodhidharma, “to pacify his soul.” Bodhidharma retorted, “Produce it and I will pacify it.” The Confucian replied, “That is my trouble, I cannot find it.” Bodhidharma said, “Your wish is granted.” The Confucian understood and departed in peace.<a id="filepos345174" href="dummy_split_280.html#filepos1005060" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">126</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">Those who know, not only that the Everlasting lives in them, but that what they, and all things, really are <em class="calibre16">is</em> the Everlasting, dwell in the groves of the wish-fulfilling trees, drink the brew of immortality, and listen everywhere to the unheard music of eternal concord. These are the immortals. The Taoist landscape paintings of China and Japan depict supremely the heavenliness of this terrestrial state. The four benevolent animals, the phoenix, the unicorn, the tortoise, and the dragon, dwell amongst the willow gardens, the bamboos, and the plums, and amid the mists of sacred mountains, close to the honored spheres. Sages, with craggy bodies but spirits eternally young, meditate among these peaks, or ride curious, symbolic animals across immortal tides, or converse delightfully over teacups to the flute of Lan Ts’ai-ho.</p>
<p class="calibre15">The mistress of the earthly paradise of the Chinese immortals is the fairy goddess Hsi Wang Mu, “The Golden Mother of the Tortoise.” She dwells in a palace on the K’unlun Mountain, which is surrounded by fragrant flowers, battlements of jewels, and a garden wall of gold.<a id="filepos346544" href="dummy_split_281.html#filepos1005290" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">127</span></sup></a> She is formed of the pure quintessence of the western air. Her guests at her periodical “Feast of the Peaches” (celebrated when the peaches ripen, once in every six thousand years) are served by the Golden Mother’s gracious daughters, in bowers and pavilions by the Lake of Gems. Waters play there from a remarkable fountain. Phoenix marrow, dragon liver, and other meats are tasted; the peaches and the wine bestow immortality. Music from invisible instruments is heard, songs that are not from mortal lips; and the dances of the visible damsels are the manifestations of the joy of eternity in time.<a id="filepos347251" href="dummy_split_282.html#filepos1005691" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">128</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">The tea ceremonies of Japan are conceived in the spirit of the Taoist earthly paradise. The tearoom, called “the abode of fancy,” is an ephemeral structure built to enclose a moment of poetic intuition. Called too “the abode of vacancy,” it is devoid of ornamentation. Temporarily it contains a single picture or flower-arrangement. The teahouse is called “the abode of the unsymmetrical”: the unsymmetrical suggests movement; the purposely unfinished leaves a vacuum into which the imagination of the beholder can pour.</p>
<p class="calibre15">The guest approaches by the garden path, and must stoop through the low entrance. He makes obeisance to the picture or flower-arrangement, to the singing kettle, and takes his place on the floor. The simplest object, framed by the controlled simplicity of the tea house, stands out in mysterious beauty, its silence holding the secret of temporal existence. Each guest is permitted to complete the experience in relation to himself. The members of the company thus contemplate the universe in miniature, and become aware of their hidden fellowship with the immortals.</p>
<p class="calibre15">The great tea masters were concerned to make of the divine wonder an experienced moment; then out of the teahouse the influence was carried into the home; and out of the home distilled into the nation.<a id="filepos348884" href="dummy_split_283.html#filepos1005993" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">129</span></sup></a> During the long and peaceful Tokugawa period (1603-1868), before the arrival of Commodore Perry in 1854, the texture of Japanese life became so imbued with significant formalization that existence to the slightest detail was a conscious expression of eternity, the landscape itself a shrine. Similarly, throughout the Orient, throughout the ancient world, and in the pre-Columbian Americas, society and nature represented to the mind the inexpressible. “The plants, rocks, fire, water, all are alive. They watch us and see our needs. They see when we have nothing to protect us,” declared an old Apache storyteller, “and it is then that they reveal themselves and speak to us.”<a id="filepos349674" href="dummy_split_284.html#filepos1006368" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">130</span></sup></a> This is what the Buddhist calls “the sermon of the inanimate.”</p>
<p class="calibre15">A certain Hindu ascetic who lay down to rest beside the holy Ganges, placed his feet up on a Shiva-symbol (a “lingam,” a combined phallus and vulva, symbolizing the union of the God with his Spouse). A passing priest observed the man reposing thus and rebuked him. “How can you dare to profane this symbol of God by resting your feet on it?” demanded the priest. The ascetic replied, “Good sir, I am sorry; but will you kindly take my feet and place them where there is no such sacred lingam?” The priest seized the ankles of the ascetic and lifted them to the right, but when he set them down a phallus sprang from the ground and they rested as before. He moved them again; another phallus received them. “Ah, I see!” said the priest, humbled; and he made obeisance to the reposing saint and went his way.</p>
<p class="calibre15">The third wonder of the Bodhisattva myth is that the first wonder (namely, the bisexual form) is symbolical of the second (the identity of eternity and time). For in the language of the divine pictures, the world of time is the great mother womb. The life therein, begotten by the father, is compounded of her darkness and his light.<a id="filepos351176" href="dummy_split_285.html#filepos1006692" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">131</span></sup></a> We are conceived in her and dwell removed from the father, but when we pass from the womb of time at death (which is our birth to eternity) we are given into his hands. The wise realize, even within this womb, that they have come from and are returning to the father; while the very wise know that she and he are in substance one.</p>
<p class="calibre15">This is the meaning of those Tibetan images of the union of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas with their own feminine aspects that have seemed so indecent to many Christian critics. According to one of the traditional ways of looking at these supports of meditation, the female form (Tibetan: <em class="calibre16">yum)</em> is to be regarded as time and the male <em class="calibre16">(yab)</em> as eternity. The union of the two is productive of the world, in which all things are at once temporal and eternal, created in the image of this self-knowing male-female God. The initiate, through meditation, is led to the recollection of this Form of forms <em class="calibre16">(yab-yum)</em> within himself. Or on the other hand, the male figure may be regarded as symbolizing the initiating principle, the method; in which case the female denotes the goal to which initiation leads. But this goal is Nirvana (eternity). And so it is that both the male and the female are to be envisioned, alternately, as time and eternity. That is to say, the two are the same, each is both, and the dual form <em class="calibre16">(yab-yum)</em> is only an effect of illusion, which itself, however, is not different from enlightenment.<a id="filepos352809" href="dummy_split_286.html#filepos1006907" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">132</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">This is a supreme statement of the great paradox by which the wall of the pairs of opposites is shattered and the candidate admitted to the vision of the God, who when he created man in his own image created him male and female. In the male’s right hand is held a thunderbolt that is the counterpart of himself, while in his left he holds a bell, symbolizing the goddess. The thunderbolt is both the method and eternity, whereas the bell is “illumined mind;” its note is the beautiful sound of eternity that is heard by the pure mind throughout creation, and therefore within itself.<a id="filepos353570" href="dummy_split_287.html#filepos1008385" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">133</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">Precisely the same bell is rung in the Christian Mass at the moment when God, through the power of the words of the consecration, descends into the bread and wine. And the Christian reading of the meaning also is the same: <em class="calibre16">Et Verbum caro factum est</em>,<a id="filepos353985" href="dummy_split_288.html#filepos1008699" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">134</span></sup></a> i.e., “The Jewel is in the Lotus”: <em class="calibre16">Om mani padme</em> Aum.<a id="filepos354146" href="dummy_split_289.html#filepos1009002" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">135</span></sup></a></p>
