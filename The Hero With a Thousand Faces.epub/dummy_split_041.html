<p class="calibre15">“T<span><span class="calibre21">HE</span></span> universal goddess makes her appearance to men under a multitude of guises; for the effects of creation are multitudinous, complex, and of mutually contradictory kind when experienced from the viewpoint of the created world. The mother of life is at the same time the mother of death; she is masked in the ugly demonesses of famine and disease.</p>
<p class="calibre15">The Sumero-Babylonian astral mythology identified the aspects of the cosmic female with the phases of the planet Venus. As morning star she was the virgin, as evening star the harlot, as lady of the night sky the consort of the moon; and when extinguished under the blaze of the sun she was the hag of hell. Wherever the Mesopotamian influence extended, the traits of the goddess were touched by the light of this fluctuating star.</p>
<p class="calibre15">A myth from southeast Africa, collected from the Wahungwe Makoni tribe of South Rhodesia, displays the aspects of the Venus-mother in co-ordination with the first stages of the cosmogonic cycle. Here the original man is the moon; the morning star his first wife, the evening star his second. Just as Väinä-möinen emerged from the womb by his own act, so this moon man emerges from the abyssal waters. He and his wives are to be the parents of the creatures of the earth. The story comes to us as follows:</p>
<p class="calibre15">“Maori (God) made the first man and called him Mwuetsi (moon). He put him on the bottom of a Dsivoa (lake) and gave him a ngona horn filled with ngona oil.<a id="filepos607048" href="dummy_split_435.html#filepos1070728" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">7</span></sup></a> Mwuetsi lived in Dsivoa.</p>
<p class="calibre15">“Mwuetsi said to Maori: ? want to go on the earth.’ Maori said: ‘You will rue it.’ Mwuetsi said: ‘None the less, I want to go on the earth.’ Maori said: ‘Then go on the earth.’ Mwuetsi went out of Dsivoa and on to the earth.</p>
<p class="calibre15">“The earth was cold and empty. There were no grasses, no bushes, no trees. There were no animals. Mwuetsi wept and said to Maori: ‘How shall I live here.’ Maori said: ‘I warned you. You have started on the path at the end of which you shall die. I will, however, give you one of your kind.’ Maori gave Mwuetsi a maiden who was called Massassi, the morning star. Maori said: ‘Massassi shall be your wife for two years.’ Maori gave Massassi a fire maker.</p>
<p class="calibre15">“In the evening Mwuetsi went into a cave with Massassi. Massassi said: ‘Help me. We will make a fire. I will gather <em class="calibre16">chimandra</em> (kindling) and you can twirl the <em class="calibre16">rusika</em> (revolving part of the fire maker).’ Massassi gathered kindling. Mwuetsi twirled the <em class="calibre16">rusika</em>. When the fire was lighted Mwuetsi lay down on one side of it, Massassi on the other. The fire burned between them.</p>
<p class="calibre15">“Mwuetsi thought to himself, ‘Why has Maori given me this maiden? What shall I do with this maiden, Massassi?’ When it was night Mwuetsi took his ngona horn. He moistened his index finger with a drop of ngona oil. Mwuetsi said, <em class="calibre16">‘Xdini chaambuka mhiri ne mhirir</em> (I am going to jump over the fire).’<a id="filepos608988" href="dummy_split_436.html#filepos1071126" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">8</span></sup></a> Mwuetsi jumped over the fire. Mwuetsi approached the maiden, Massassi. Mwuetsi touched Massassi’s body with the ointment on his finger. Then Mwuetsi went back to his bed and slept.</p>
<p class="calibre15">“When Mwuetsi wakened in the morning he looked over to Massassi. Mwuetsi saw that Massassi’s body was swollen. When day broke Massassi began to bear. Massassi bore grasses. Massassi bore bushes. Massassi bore trees. Massassi did not stop bearing till the earth was covered with grasses, bushes and trees.</p>
<p class="calibre15">“The trees grew. They grew till their tops reached the sky. When the tops of the trees reached the sky it began to rain.</p>
<p class="calibre15">“Mwuetsi and Massassi lived in plenty. They had fruits and grain. Mwuetsi built a house. Mwuetsi made an iron shovel. Mwuetsi made a hoe and planted crops. Massassi plaited fish traps and caught fish. Massassi fetched wood and water. Massassi cooked. Thus Mwuetsi and Massassi lived for two years.</p>
<p class="calibre15">“After two years Maori said to Massassi, ‘The time is up.’ Maori took Massassi from the earth and put her back in Dsivoa. Mwuetsi wailed. He wailed and wept and said to Maori: ‘What shall I do without Massassi? Who will fetch wood and water for me? Who will cook for me?’ Eight days long Mwuetsi wept.</p>
<p class="calibre15">“Eight days long Mwuetsi wept. Then Maori said: ‘I have warned you that you are going to your death. But I will give you another woman. I will give you Morongo, the evening star. Mo-rongo will stay with you for two years. Then I shall take her back again.’ Maori gave Mwuetsi Morongo.</p>
<p class="calibre15">“Morongo came to Mwuetsi in the hut. In the evening Mwuetsi wanted to lie down on his side of the fire. Morongo said: ‘Do not lie down over there. Lie with me.’ Mwuetsi lav down beside Morongo. Mwuetsi took the ngona horn, put some ointment on his index finger. But Morongo said: ‘Don’t be like that. I am not like Massassi. Now smear your loins with ngona oil. Smear my loins with ngona oil.’ Mwuetsi did as he was told. Morongo said: ‘Now couple with me.’ Mwuetsi coupled with Morongo. Mwuetsi went to sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre15">“Towards morning Mwuetsi woke. As he looked over to Morongo he saw that her body was swollen. As day broke Morongo began to give birth. The first day Morongo gave birth to chickens, sheep, goats.</p>
<p class="calibre15">“The second night Mwuetsi slept with Morongo again. The next morning she bore eland and cattle.</p>
<p class="calibre15">“The third night Mwuetsi slept with Morongo again. The next morning Morongo bore first boys and then girls. The boys who were born in the morning were grown up by nightfall.</p>
<p class="calibre15">“On the fourth night Mwuetsi wanted to sleep with Morongo again. But there came a thunderstorm and Maori spoke: ‘Let be. You are going quickly to your death.’ Mwuetsi was afraid. The thunderstorm passed over. When it had gone Morongo said to Mwuetsi: ‘Make a door and then use it to close the entrance to the hut. Then Maori will not be able to see what we are doing. Then you can sleep with me.’ Mwuetsi made a door. With it he closed the entrance to the hut. Then he slept with Morongo. Mwuetsi slept.</p>
<p class="calibre15">“Towards morning Mwuetsi woke. Mwuetsi saw that Mo-rongo’s body was swollen. As day broke Morongo began to give birth. Morongo bore lions, leopards, snakes, and scorpions. Maori saw it. Maori said to Mwuetsi: ? warned you.’</p>
<p class="calibre15">“On the fifth night Mwuetsi wanted to sleep with Morongo again. But Morongo said: ‘Look, your daughters are grown. Couple with your daughters.’ Mwuetsi looked at his daughters. He saw that they were beautiful and that they were grown up. So he slept with them. They bore children. The children which were born in the morning were full grown by night. And so Mwuetsi became the Mambo (king) of a great people.</p>
<p class="calibre15">“But Morongo slept with the snake. Morongo no longer gave birth. She lived with the snake. One day Mwuetsi returned to Morongo and wanted to sleep with her. Morongo said: ‘Let be.’ Mwuetsi said: ‘But I want to.’ He lay with Morongo. Under Morongo’s bed lay the snake. The snake bit Mwuetsi. Mwuetsi sickened.</p>
<p class="calibre15">“After the snake had bitten Mwuetsi, Mwuetsi sickened. The next day it did not rain. The plants withered. The rivers and lakes dried. The animals died. The people began to die. Many people died. Mwuetsi’s children asked: ‘What can we do?’ Mwuetsi’s children said: ‘We will consult the hakata (sacred dice).’ The children consulted the hakata. The hakata said: ‘Mwuetsi the Mambo is sick and pining. Send Mwuetsi back to the Dsivoa.’</p>
<p class="calibre15">“Thereupon Mwuetsi’s children strangled Mwuetsi and buried him. They buried Morongo with Mwuetsi. Then they chose another man to be Mambo. Morongo, too, had lived for two years in Mwuetsi’s Zimbabwe.”<a id="filepos615075" href="dummy_split_437.html#filepos1071401" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">9</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">It is clear that each of the three stages of procreation represents an epoch in the development of the world. The pattern for the procession was foreknown, almost as something already observed; this is indicated by the warning of the All-Highest. But the Moon Man, the Mighty Living One, would not be denied the realization of his destiny. The conversation at the bottom of the lake is the dialogue of eternity and time, the “Colloquy of the Quick”: “To be, or not to be.” Unquenchable desire is finally given its rope: movement begins.</p>
<p class="calibre15">The wives and daughters of the Moon Man are the personifications and precipitators of his destiny. With the evolution of his world-creative will the virtues and features of the goddess-mother were metamorphosed. After the birth from the elemental womb, the first two wives were prehuman, suprahuman. But as the cosmogonic round proceeded and the growing moment passed from its primordial to its human-historical forms, the mistresses of the cosmic births withdrew, and the field remained to the women of men. Thereupon the old demiurgic sire in the midst of his community became a metaphysical anachronism. When at last he grew tired of the merely human and yearned back again to the wife of his abundance, the world sickened a moment under the pull of his reaction, but then released itself and ran free. The initiative passed to the community of the children. The symbolic, dream-heavy parental figures subsided into the original abyss. Only man remained on the furnished earth. The cycle had moved on.</p>
