<blockquote class="calibre25"><p id="filepos975861" class="calibre22"><a href="dummy_split_020.html#filepos293430" class="calibre17">65</a> For an astounding revelation of the survival in contemporary Melanesia of a symbolic system essentially identical with that of the Egypto-Babylonian, Trojan-Cretan “labyrinth complex” of the second millennium <span><span class="calibre21">B.C</span></span>., cf. John Layard, <em class="calibre16">Stone Men of Malekula</em> (London: Chatto and Windus, 1942). W. F. J. Knight, in his <em class="calibre16">Cumaean Gates</em> (Oxford, 1936), has discussed the evident relationship of the Malekulan “journey of the soul to the underworld” with the classical descent of Aeneas, and the Babylonian of Gilgamesh. W. J. Perry, <em class="calibre16">The Children of the Sun</em> (New York: E. P. Dutton and Co., 1923), thought he could recognize evidences of this culture-continuity running all the way from Egypt and Sumer out through the Oceanic area to North America. Many scholars have pointed out the close correspondences between the details of the classical Greek and primitive Australian rites of initiation, notably Jane Harrison, <em class="calibre16">Themis, A Study of the Social Origins of Greek Religion</em> (2nd revised edition; Cambridge University Press, 1927).</p></blockquote>
<p class="calibre15">It is still uncertain by what means and in what eras the mythological and cultural patterns of the various archaic civilizations may have been disseminated to the farthest corners of the earth; yet it can be stated categorically that few (if any) of the so-called “primitive cultures” studied by our anthropologists represent autochthonous growths. They are, rather, local adaptations, provincial degenerations, and immensely old fossilizations, of folkways that were developed in very different lands, often under much less simple circumstances, and by other races.</p>
