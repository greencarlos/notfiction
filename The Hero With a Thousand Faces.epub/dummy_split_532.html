<blockquote class="calibre25"><p id="filepos1114755" class="calibre22"><a href="dummy_split_007.html#filepos73989" class="calibre17">38</a> The point is that Buddhahood, Enlightenment, cannot be communicated, but only the <em class="calibre16">way</em> to Enlightenment. This doctrine of the incommunicability of the Truth which is beyond names and forms is basic to the great Oriental, as well as to the Platonic, traditions. Whereas the truths of science are communicable, being demonstrable hypotheses rationally founded on observable facts, ritual, mythology, and metaphysics are but guides to the brink of a transcendent illumination, the final step to which must be taken by each in his own silent experience. Hence one of the Sanskrit terms for sage is <em class="calibre16">muni</em>, “the silent one.” <em class="calibre16">Sakyamuni</em> (one of the titles of Gautama Buddha) means “the silent one or sage <em class="calibre16">(muni)</em> of the Sakya clan.” Though he is the founder of a widely taught world religion, the ultimate core of his doctrine remains concealed, necessarily, in silence.</p></blockquote>
