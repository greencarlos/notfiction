<blockquote class="calibre25"><p id="filepos931778" class="calibre22"><a href="dummy_split_014.html#filepos161425" class="calibre17">40</a> David Clement Scott, <em class="calibre16">A Cyclopaedic Dictionary of the Mang’anja Language spoken in British Central Africa</em> (Edinburgh, i8g2), p. 97. Compare the following dream of a twelve-year-old boy: “One night I dreamt of a foot. I thought it was lying down on the floor and I, not expecting such a thing, fell over it. It seemed to be the same shape as my own foot. The foot suddenly jumped up and started running after me; I thought I jumped right through the window, ran round the yard out into the street, running along as fast as my legs would carry me. I thought I ran to Woolwich, and then it suddenly caught me and shook me, and then I woke up. I have dreamt about this foot several times.”</p></blockquote>
<p class="calibre15">The boy had heard a report that his father, who was a sailor, had recently had an accident at sea in which he had broken his ankle (C. W. Kimmins, <em class="calibre16">Children’s Dreams, An Unexplored Land;</em> London: George Allen and Un-win, Ltd., 1937, p. 107).</p>
<p class="calibre15">“The foot,” writes Dr. Freud, “is an age-old sexual symbol which occurs even in mythology” <em class="calibre16">(Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality</em>, p. 155). The name Oedipus, it should be noted, means “the swollen footed.”</p>
