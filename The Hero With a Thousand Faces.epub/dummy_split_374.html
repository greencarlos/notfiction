<blockquote class="calibre25"><p id="filepos1046415" class="calibre22"><a href="dummy_split_033.html#filepos520723" class="calibre17">5</a> This recognition of the secondary natur e of the personality of whatever deity is worshiped is characteristic of most of the traditions of the world (see, for example, supra, p.:81, not e 154). In Christianity, Mohammedanism, and Judaism, however, the personality of the divinity is taught to be finalâ€”which makes it comparatively difficult for the members of these communions to understand how one may go beyond the limitations of their own anthro-pomorphic divinity. The result has been, on the one hand, a general obfuscation of the symbols, and on the other, a god-ridden bigotry such as is unmatched elsewhere in the history of religion. For a discussion of the possible origin of this aberration, see Sigmund Freud, <em class="calibre16">Moses and Monotheism</em> (translated by James Strachey; Standard Edn., XXIII, 1964). (Orig. 1939.)</p></blockquote>
