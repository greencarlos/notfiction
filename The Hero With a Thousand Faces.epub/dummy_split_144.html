<blockquote class="calibre25"><p id="filepos938228" class="calibre22"><a href="dummy_split_014.html#filepos178972" class="calibre17">51</a> The thunderbolt <em class="calibre16">(vajra)</em> is one of the major symbols in Buddhist iconography, signifying the spiritual power of Buddhahood (indestructible enlightenment) which shatters the illusory realities of the world. The Absolute, or Adi Buddha, is represented in the images of Tibet as Vajra-Dhara (Tibetan: <em class="calibre16">Dorje-Chang)</em> “Holder of the Adamantine Bolt.”</p></blockquote>
<p class="calibre15">In the figures of the gods that have come down from ancient Mesopotamia (Sumer and Akkad, Babylonia and Assyria) the thunderbolt, in the same form as the vajra, is a conspicuous element (See Plate XXI); from these it was inherited by Zeus.</p>
<p class="calibre15">We know also that among primitive peoples warriors may speak of their weapons as thunderbolts. <em class="calibre16">Sicut in coelo et in terra:</em> the initiated warrior is an agent of the divine will; his training is not only in manual but also in spiritual skills. Magic (the supernatural power of the thunderbolt), as well as physical force and chemical poison, gives the lethal energy to his blows. A consummate master would require no physical weapon at all; the power of his magic word would suffice.</p>
<p class="calibre15">The parable of Prince Five-weapons illustrates this theme. But it also teaches that the one who relies or prides himself upon his merely empirical, physical character is already undone. “We have here the picture of a hero,” writes Dr. Coomaraswamy, “who can be involved in the coils of an aesthetic experience [“the five points” being the five senses], but is able, by an intrinsic moral superiority, to liberate himself, and even to release others” <em class="calibre16">(Journal of American Folklore</em>, 57, 1944, p. 129).</p>
