<p class="calibre22"><span><span class="calibre21">SAINT THOMAS AQUINAS</span></span> declares: “The name of being wise is reserved to him alone whose consideration is about the end of the universe, which end is also the beginning of the universe.”<a id="filepos542390" href="dummy_split_389.html#filepos1053350" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">20</span></sup></a> The basic principle of all mythology is this of the beginning in the end. Creation myths are pervaded with a sense of the doom that is continually recalling all created shapes to the imperishable out of which they first emerged. The forms go forth powerfully, but inevitably reach their apogee, break, and return. Mythology, in this sense, is tragic in its view. But in the sense that it places our true being not in the forms that shatter but in the imperishable out of which they again immediately bubble forth, mythology is eminently untragical.<a id="filepos543021" href="dummy_split_390.html#filepos1053555" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">21</span></sup></a> Indeed, wherever the mythological mood prevails, tragedy is impossible. A quality rather of dream prevails. True being, meanwhile, is not in the shapes but in the dreamer.</p>
<p class="calibre15">As in dream, the images range from the sublime to the ridiculous. The mind is not permitted to rest with its normal evaluations, but is continually insulted and shocked out of the assurance that now, at last, it has understood. Mythology is defeated when the mind rests solemnly with its favorite or traditional images, defending them as though they themselves were the message that they communicate. These images are to be regarded as no more than shadows from the unfathomable reach beyond, where the eye goeth not, speech goeth not, nor the mind, nor even piety. Like the trivialities of dream, those of myth are big with meaning.</p>
<p class="calibre15">The first phase of the cosmogonie cycle describes the breaking of formlessness into form, as in the following creation chant of the Maoris of New Zealand:</p>

<p class="calibre22">In space were evolved two existences without shape:</p>
<div class="calibre1"><blockquote class="calibre25"><span class="calibre7">
<p class="calibre22">Maku (Moisture [a male])<br class="calibre5"/>Mahora-nui-a-rangi (Great Expanse of Heaven [a female]).</p>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre9"> </div>
<p class="calibre22">From these sprang:</p>
<div class="calibre1"><blockquote class="calibre25"><span class="calibre7">
<p class="calibre22">Rangi-potiki (The Heavens [a male])<br class="calibre5"/>Papa (Earth [a female]).</p>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre9"> </div>
<p class="calibre22">Rangi-potiki and Papa were the parents of the gods.<a id="filepos546914" href="dummy_split_391.html#filepos1053762" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">22</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">From the void beyond all voids unfold the world-sustaining emanations, plantlike, mysterious. The tenth of the above series is night; the eighteenth, space or ether, the frame of the visible world; the nineteenth is the male-female polarity; the twentieth is the universe we see. Such a series suggests the depth beyond depth of the mystery of being. The levels correspond to the profundities sounded by the hero in his world-fathoming adventure; they number the spiritual strata known to the mind introverted in meditation. They represent the bottomlessness of the dark night of the soul.<a id="filepos547658" href="dummy_split_392.html#filepos1054046" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">23</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">The Hebrew cabala represents the process of creation as a series of emanations out of the I AM of The Great Face. The first is the head itself, in profile, and from this proceed “nine splendid lights.” The emanations are represented also as the branches of a cosmic tree, which is upside down, rooted in “the inscrutable height.” The world that we see is the reverse image of that tree.</p>
<p class="calibre15">According to the Indian Samkhya philosophers of the eighth century <span><span class="calibre21">B.C</span></span>., the void condenses into the element ether or space. From this air is precipitated. From air comes fire, from fire water, and from water the element earth. With each element evolves a sense-function capable of perceiving it: hearing, touch, sight, taste, and smell respectively.<a id="filepos548685" href="dummy_split_393.html#filepos1054507" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">24</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">An amusing Chinese myth personifies these emanating elements as five venerable sages, who come stepping out of a ball of chaos, suspended in the void:</p>
<p class="calibre15">“Before heaven and earth had become separated from each other, everything was a great ball of mist, called chaos. At that time, the spirits of the five elements took shape, and then developed into five ancients. The first was called the Yellow Ancient, and he was the master of earth. The second was called the Red Ancient, and he was the master of fire. The third was called the Dark Ancient, and he was the master of water. The fourth was called the Wood Prince, and he was the master of wood. The fifth was called the Metal Mother, and she was the mistress of metals.<a id="filepos549640" href="dummy_split_394.html#filepos1054825" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">25</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">“Now each of these five ancients set in motion the primordial spirit from which he had proceeded, so that water and earth sank downward; the heavens soared aloft and the earth became fast in the depths. Then the water gathered into rivers and lakes, and the mountains and plains appeared. The heavens cleared and the earth divided; then there were sun, moon, and all the stars, sand, clouds, rain, and dew. The Yellow Ancient gave play to the purest power of the earth, and to this were added the operations of fire and water. Then there sprang into being the grasses and trees, birds and animals, and the generations of the snakes and insects, and fishes and turtles. The Wood Prince and the Metal Mother brought light and darkness together and thereby created the human race, as man and woman. Thus gradually appeared the world….”<a id="filepos550648" href="dummy_split_395.html#filepos1055091" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">26</span></sup></a></p>
