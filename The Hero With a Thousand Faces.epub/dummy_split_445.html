<blockquote class="calibre25"><p id="filepos1074196" class="calibre22"><a href="dummy_split_046.html#filepos639564" class="calibre17">4</a>This formula is, of course, not precisely that of the common Christian teaching, where, though Jesus is reported to have declared that “the kingdom of God is within you,” the churches maintain that, since man is created only “in the image” of God, the distinction between the soul and its creator is absolute—thus retaining, as the final reach of their wisdom, the dualistic distinction between man’s “eternal soul” and the divinity. The transcending of this pair of opposites is not encouraged (indeed, is rejected as “pantheism” and has sometimes been rewarded with the stake); nevertheless, the prayers and diaries of the Christian mystics abound in ecstatic descriptions of the unitive, soul-shattering experience (viz. <em class="calibre16">supra</em>, pp. 39-40), while Dante’s vision at the conclusion of the Divine Comedy <em class="calibre16">(supra</em>, p. 190) certainly goes beyond the orthodox, dualistic, concretistic dogma of the finality of the personalities of the Trinity. Where this dogma is not transcended the myth of Going to the Father is taken literally, as describing man’s final goal. (See <em class="calibre16">supra</em>, p. 258, footnote 5.)</p></blockquote>
