<blockquote class="calibre25"><p id="filepos929329" class="calibre22"><a href="dummy_split_013.html#filepos151470" class="calibre17">34</a> Compare the frog of the fairy tale. In pre-Mohammedan Arabia the Jinn (singular: <em class="calibre16">m</em>. <strong class="calibre46">Jinni; <em class="calibre16">f</em>. Jinniyah) were haunting-demons of the deserts and wilderness. Hairy and misformed, or else shaped as animals, ostriches, or serpents, they were very dangerous to unprotected persons. The Prophet Mohammed admitted the existence of these heathen spirits (Koran</strong>, 37:158), and incorporated them in the Mohammedan system, which recognizes three created intelligences under Allah: Angels formed of light, Jinn of subtle fire, and Man of the dust of the earth. The Mohammedan Jinn have the power of putting on any form they please, but not grosser than the essence of fire and smoke, and they can thus make themselves visible to mortals. There are three orders of Jinn: flyers, walkers, and divers. Many are supposed to have accepted the True Faith, and these are regarded as good; the rest are bad. The latter dwell and work in close association with the Fallen Angels, whose chief is Iblis (“the Despairer”).</p></blockquote>
