<blockquote class="calibre25"><p id="filepos928126" class="calibre22"><a href="dummy_split_013.html#filepos150512" class="calibre17">32</a> The following dream supplies a vivid example of the fusion of opposites in the unconscious: “I dreamed that I had gone into a street of brothels and to one of the girls. As I entered, she changed into a man, who was lying, half clothed, on a sofa. He said: ‘It doesn’t disturb you (that I am now a man)?’ The man looked old, and he had white sideburns. He reminded me of a certain chief forester who was a good friend of my father.” (Wilhelm Stekel, <em class="calibre16">Die Sprache des Traumes</em>, pp. 70-71.) “All dreams,” Dr. Stekel observes, “have a bisexual tendency. Where the bisexuality cannot be perceived, it is hidden in the latent dream content” <em class="calibre16">(ibid.</em>, p. 71).</p></blockquote>
