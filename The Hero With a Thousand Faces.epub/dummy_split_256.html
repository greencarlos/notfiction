From all the pores of his hair there arose the smell of lotus, and he was pleasing to everybody, gracious and beautiful; endowed with the fulness of the best bright color. As his body was adorne d with all the good signs and marks, there arose from the pores of his hai r and from the palms of his hands all sorts of precious ornaments in the shape of all kinds of flowers, incense, scents, garlands, ointments, umbrellas, flags, and banners, and in the shape of all kinds of instrumental music. And there appeared also, streaming forth from the palms of his hands, all kinds of viands and drink, food, hard and soft, and sweetmeats, and all kinds of enjoyments and pleasures” (<em class="calibre16">The Larger Sukhavati-Vyuha</em>, 10; “Sacred Books of the East.” Vol. XLIX, Part II, pp. 26-27).</p></blockquote>
