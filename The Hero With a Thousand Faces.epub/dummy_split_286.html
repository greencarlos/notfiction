<blockquote class="calibre25"><p id="filepos1006907" class="calibre22"><a href="dummy_split_021.html#filepos352809" class="calibre17">132</a> Comparatively, the Hindu goddess Kali <em class="calibre16">(supra</em>, p. 115) is shown standing on the prostrate form of the god Shiva, her spouse. She brandishes the sword of death, i.e., spiritual discipline. The blood-dripping human head tells the devotee that he that loseth his life for her sake shall find it. The gestures of “fear not” and “bestowing boons” teach that she protects her children, that the pairs of opposites of the universal agony are not what they seem, and that for one centered in eternity the phantasmagoria of temporal “goods” and “evils” is but a reflex of the mind—as the goddess herself, though apparently trampling down the god, is actually his blissful dream.</p></blockquote>
<p class="calibre15">Beneath the goddess of the Island of Jewels (see <em class="calibre16">supra</em>, pp. 113-114) two aspects of the god are represented: the one, face upward, in union with her, is the creative, world-enjoying aspect; but the other, turned away, is the <em class="calibre16">deus absconditus</em>, the divine essence in and by itself, beyond event and change, inactive, dormant, void, beyond even the wonder of the hermaphroditic mystery. (See Zimmer, <em class="calibre16">Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization</em>, pp. 210-214.)</p>
