<p class="calibre15">Compare the following Christian letter:</p>
<p class="calibre15"><em class="calibre16">In the Year of Our Lord 1682</em> To ye aged and beloved, Mr. John Higginson:</p>
<p class="calibre15">There be now at sea a ship called <em class="calibre16">Welcome</em>, which has on board <span><span class="calibre21">100</span></span> or more of the heretics and inalignants called Quakers, with W. Penn, who is the chief scamp, at the head of them. The General Court has accordingly given sacred orders to Master Malachi Huscott, of the brig <em class="calibre16">Porpoise</em>, to waylay the said <em class="calibre16">Welcome</em> slyly as near the Cape of Cod as may be, and make captive the said Penn and his ungodly crew, so that the Lord may be glorified and not mocked on the soil of this new country with the heathen worship of these people. Much spoil can be made of selling the whole lot to Barbadoes, where slaves fetch good prices in rum and sugar and we shall not only do the Lord great good by punishing the wicked, but we shall make great good for His Minister and people.</p>
<p class="calibre15">Yours in the bowels of Christ,</p>
<p class="calibre20"><span><span class="calibre21">COTTON</span></span>
<span><span class="calibre21">MATHER</span></span></p>
