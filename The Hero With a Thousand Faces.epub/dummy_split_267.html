It is certainly true that there, as well as here, many have known that the proper field of battle is not geographical but psychological (compare Rumi, <em class="calibre16">Mathnawi</em>, 2. 2525: “What is ‘beheading’? Slaying the carnal soul in the holy war.”); nevertheless, the popular and orthodox expression of both the Mohammedan and the Christian doctrines has been so ferocious that it requires a very sophisticated reading to discern in either mission the operation of love.</p></blockquote>
