Knopf, Inc., 1926-28), Vol. I, p. 144. “Supposing,” adds Spengler, “that Napoleon himself, as ‘empirical person,’ had fallen at Marengo—then that which he <em class="calibre16">signified</em> would have been actualized in some other form.” The hero, who in this sense and to this degree has become depersonalized, incarnates, during the period of his epochal action, the dynamism of the culture process; “between himself as a fact and the other facts there is a harmony of metaphysical rhythm” <em class="calibre16">(ibid.</em>, p. 142). This corresponds to Thomas Carlyle’s idea of the Hero King, as “Ableman” <em class="calibre16">(On Heroes, Hero-Worship and The Heroic in History</em>, Lecture VI).</p></blockquote>
