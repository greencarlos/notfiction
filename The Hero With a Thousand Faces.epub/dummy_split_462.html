<blockquote class="calibre25"><p id="filepos1082764" class="calibre22"><a href="dummy_split_047.html#filepos676940" class="calibre17">21</a> I am here keeping the distinction between the earlier semi-animal titan-hero (city founder, culture giver) and the later, fully human type. (See pp. <span><span class="calibre21">315-319</span></span>, <em class="calibre16">supra.)</em> The deeds of the latter frequently include the slaying of the former, the Pythons and Minotaurs who were the boon givers of the past. (A god outgrown becomes immediately a life-destroying demon. The form has to be broken and the energies released.) Not infrequently deeds that belong to the earlier stages of the cycle are assigned to the human hero, or one of the earlier heroes may be humanized and carried on into a later day; but such contaminations and variations do not alter the general formula.</p></blockquote>
