When I hear some hymns, sermons, and prayers taking for granted or asserting with naïve simplicity that this vast, ruthless cosmos, with all the monstrous accidents which it involves, is a neatly planned and personally conducted tour, I recall the mor e reasonable hypothesis of an East African tribe. ‘They say,’ reports an observer, ‘that although Go d is good and wishes good for everybody, unfortunately he has a half-witted brother who is always interfering with what he does.’ That, at least, bears some resemblance to the facts. God’s half-witted brother might explain some of life’s sickening and insane tragedies which the idea of an omnipotent individual of boundless good will toward every soul most certainly does not explain.” (Harry Emerson Fosdick, <em class="calibre16">As I See Religion</em>, New York: Harpe r and Brothers, publisher, 1932, pp. 53-54.)</p></blockquote>
