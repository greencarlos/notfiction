<blockquote class="calibre25"><p id="filepos1001127" class="calibre22"><a href="dummy_split_021.html#filepos336931" class="calibre17">120</a> “The verb <em class="calibre16">nirvâ</em> (Sanskrit) is, literally, ‘to blow out,’ not transitively, but as a fire ceases to draw…. Deprived of fuel, the fire of life is ‘pacified,’ i.e., quenched, when the mind has been curbed, one attains to the ‘peace of Nirvana,’ ‘despiration in God.’ … It is by ceasing to feed our fires that the peace is reached, of which it is well said in another tradition that ‘it passeth understanding’ “ (Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, <em class="calibre16">Hinduism and Buddhism;</em> New York: The Philosophical Library, no date, p. 63). The word “de-spiration” is contrived from a literal Latinization of the Sanskrit <em class="calibre16">“nirvana;”</em> nir=“out, forth, outward, out of, out from, away, away from;” Vāa=“blown out, gone out, extinguished.”</p></blockquote>
