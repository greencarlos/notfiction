<blockquote class="calibre25"><p id="filepos1013641" class="calibre22"><a href="dummy_split_022.html#filepos366551" class="calibre17">150</a> In the published psychoanalytical literature, the dream sources of the symbols are analyzed, as well as their latent meanings for the unconscious, and the effects of their operation upon the psyche; but the further fact that great teachers have employed them consciously as metaphors remains unregarded: the tacit assumption being that the great teachers of the past were neurotics (except, of course, a number of the Greeks and Romans) who mistook their uncriticised fantasies for revelation. In the same spirit, the revelations of psychoanalysis are regarded by many laymen to be productions of the “salacious mind” of Dr. Freud.</p></blockquote>
