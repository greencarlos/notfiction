<blockquote class="calibre25"><p id="filepos1064431" class="calibre22"><a href="dummy_split_038.html#filepos586315" class="calibre17">52</a> A broad distinction can be made between the mythologies of the truly primitive (fishing, hunting, root-digging, and berry-picking) peoples and those of the civilizations that came into being following the development of the arts of agriculture, dairying, and herding, <em class="calibre16">ca</em>. 6000 <span><span class="calibre21">B.C</span></span>. Most of what we call primitive, however, is actually colonial, i.e., diffused from some high culture renter and adapted to the needs of a simpler society. It is in order to avoid the misleading term, “primitive,” that I am calling the undeveloped or degenerate traditions “folk mythologies.” The term is adequate for the purposes of the present elementary comparative study of the universal forms, though it would certainly not serve for a strict historical analysis.</p></blockquote>
