<blockquote class="calibre25"><p id="filepos982083" class="calibre22"><a href="dummy_split_021.html#filepos311946" class="calibre17">83</a> Hinayana Buddhism (the Buddhism surviving in Ceylon, Burma, and Siam) reveres the Buddha as a human hero, a supreme saint and sage. Mahayana Buddhism, on the other hand (the Buddhism of the north), regards the Enlightened One as a world savior, an incarnation of the universal principle of enlightenment.</p></blockquote>
<p class="calibre15">A Bodhisattva is a personage on the point of Buddhahood: according to the Hinayana view, an adept who will become a Buddha in a subsequent reincarnation; according to the Mahayana view (as the following paragraphs will show), a type of world savior, representing particularly the universal principle of compassion. The word <em class="calibre16">bodhisattva</em> (Sanskrit) means: “whose being or essence is enlightenment.”</p>
<p class="calibre15">Mahayana Buddhism has developed a pantheon of many Bodhisattvas and many past and future Buddhas. These all inflect the manifested powers of the transcendent, one and only Adi-Buddha (“Primal Buddha”) (compare note 51, p. 87, <em class="calibre16">supra)</em>, who is the highest conceivable source and ultimate boundary of all being, suspended in the void of nonbeing like a wonderful bubble.</p>
