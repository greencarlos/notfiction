<p class="calibre22"><span><span class="calibre21">THE</span></span> forward roll of the cosmogonic round precipitates the One into the many. Herewith a great crisis, a rift, splits the created world into two apparently contradictory planes of being. In Paiore’s chart the people emerge from the lower darknesses and immediately go to work to elevate the sky.<a id="filepos566993" href="dummy_split_411.html#filepos1059869" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">42</span></sup></a> They are revealed as moving with an apparent independence. They hold councils, they decide, they plan; they take over the work of arranging the world. Yet we know that behind the scenes the Unmoved Mover is at work, like a puppetmaster.</p>
<p class="calibre15">In mythology, wherever the Unmoved Mover, the Mighty Living One, holds the center of attention, there is a miraculous spontaneity about the shaping of the universe. The elements condense and move into play of their own accord, or at the Creator’s slightest word; the portions of the self-shattering cosmic egg go to their stations without aid. But when the perspective shifts, to focus on living beings, when the panorama of space and nature is faced from the standpoint of the personages ordained to inhabit it, then a sudden transformation overshadows the cosmic scene. No longer do the forms of the world appear to move in the patterns of a living, growing, harmonious thing, but stand recalcitrant, or at best inert. The props of the universal stage have to be adjusted, even beaten into shape. The earth brings forth thoms and thistles; man eats bread in the sweat of his brow.</p>
<p class="calibre15">Two modes of myth therefore confront us. According to one, the demiurgic forces continue to operate of themselves; according to the other, they give up the initiative and even set themselves against the further progress of the cosmogonic round. The difficulties represented in this latter form of myth begin even as early as during the long darkness of the original, creature-begetting embrace of the cosmic parents. Let the Maoris introduce us to this terrible theme:</p>
<p class="calibre15">Rangi (the Sky) lay so close on the belly of Papa (Mother Earth) that the children could not break free from the womb. “They were in an unstable condition, floating about the world of darkness, and this was their appearance: some were crawling … some were upright with arms held up … some lying on their sides … some on their backs, some were stooping, some with their heads bent down, some with legs drawn up … some kneeling … some feeling about in the dark…. They were all within the embrace of Rangi and Papa….</p>
<p class="calibre15">“At last the beings who had been begotten by Heaven and Earth, worn out by the continued darkness, consulted among themselves, saying, ‘Let us now determine what we should do with Rangi and Papa, whether it would be better to slay them or to rend them apart.’ Then spake Tu-matauenga, the fiercest of the children of Heaven and Earth, ‘It is well, let us slay them.’</p>
<p class="calibre15">“Then spake Tane-mahuta, the father of the forests and of all things that inhabit them, or that are constructed from trees, ‘Nay, not so. It is better to rend them apart, and to let the heaven stand far above us, and the earth lie under our feet. Let the sky become a stranger to us, but the earth remain close to us as our nursing mother.’ “</p>
<p class="calibre15">Several of the brother gods vainly tried to rend apart the heavens and the earth. At last it was Tane-mahuta himself, the father of the forests and of all things that inhabit them, or that are constructed from trees, who succeeded in the titanic project. “His head is now firmly planted on his mother the earth, his feet he raises up and rests against his father the skies, he strains his back and limbs with mighty effort. Now are rent apart Rangi and Papa, and with cries and groans of woe they shriek aloud. “Wherefore slay you thus your parents? Why commit you so dreadful a crime as to slay us, as to rend your parents apart?’ But Tane-mahuta pauses not, he regards not their shrieks and cries; far, far beneath him he presses down the earth; far, far above him, he thrusts up the sky….”<a id="filepos571274" href="dummy_split_412.html#filepos1060425" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">43</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">As known to the Greeks, this story is rendered by Hesiod in his account of the separation of Ouranos (Father Heaven) from Gaia (Mother Earth). According to this variant, the Titan Kronos castrated his father with a sickle and pushed him up out of the way.<a id="filepos571684" href="dummy_split_413.html#filepos1060767" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">44</span></sup></a> In Egyptian iconography the position of the cosmic couple is inverted: the sky is the mother, the father is the vitality of the earth;<a id="filepos571901" href="dummy_split_414.html#filepos1061054" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">45</span></sup></a> but the pattern of the myth remains: the two were pushed asunder by their child, the air god Shu. Again the image comes to us from the ancient cuneiform texts of the Sumerians, dating from the third and fourth millenniums <span><span class="calibre21">B.C</span></span>. First was the primeval ocean; the primeval ocean generated the cosmic mountain, which consisted of heaven and earth united; An (the Heaven Father) and Ki (the Earth Mother) produced Enlil (the Air God), who presently separated An from Ki and then himself united with his mother to beget mankind.<a id="filepos572541" href="dummy_split_415.html#filepos1061313" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">46</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">But if these deeds of the desperate children seem violent, they are as nothing compared with the total carving up of the parent power which we discover recorded in the Icelandic <em class="calibre16">Eddas</em>, and in the Babylonian <em class="calibre16">Tablets of Creation</em>. The final insult here is given in the characterization of the demiurgic presence of the abyss as “evil,” “dark,” “obscene.” The bright young warrior-sons, now disdaining the generative source, the personage of the seed-state of deep sleep, summarily slay it, hack it, slice it into lengths, and carpenter it into the structure of the world. <em class="calibre16">1</em>
<em class="calibre16">his</em> is the pattern for victory of all our later slayings of the dragon, the beginning of the agelong history of the deeds of the hero.</p>
<p class="calibre15">According to the Eddic account, after the “yawning gap”<a id="filepos573621" href="dummy_split_416.html#filepos1061533" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">47</span></sup></a> had given forth in the north a mist-world of cold and in the south a region of fire, and after the heat from the south had played on the rivers of ice that crowded down from the north, a yeasty venom began to be exuded. From this a drizzle arose, which in turn congealed to rime. The rime melted and dripped; life was quickened from the drippings in the form of a torpid, gigantic, hermaphroditic, horizontal figure named Ymir. The giant slept, and as it slept it sweated; one of its feet begat with the other a son, while under its left hand germinated a man and wife.</p>
<p class="calibre15">The rime continually melted and dripped, and there condensed from it the cow, Audumla. From her udder flowed four streams of milk, which were drunk for nourishment by Ymir. But the cow, for her own nourishment, licked the iceblocks, which were salty. The evening of the first day she licked, a man’s hair came forth from the blocks; the second day a man’s head; the third, the entire man was there, and his name was Buri. Now Buri had a son (the mother is not known) named Borr, who married one of the giant daughters of the creatures that had sprung from Ymir. She gave birth to the trinity of Othin, Vili, and Ve, and these then slaughtered sleepful Ymir and carved the body into chunks.</p>

<p class="calibre15">In the Babylonian version the hero is Marduk, the sun-god; the victim is Tiamat—terrifying, dragonlike, attended by swarms of demons—a female personification of the original abyss itself: chaos as the mother of the gods, but now the menace of the world. With bow and trident, club and net, and a convoy of battle-winds, the god mounted his chariot. The four horses, trained to trample underfoot, were flecked with foam.</p>

<p class="calibre15">The myths never tire of illustrating the point that conflict in the created world is not what it seems. Tiamat, though slain and dismembered, was not thereby undone. Had the battle been viewed from another angle, the chaos-monster would have been seen to shatter of her own accord, and her hagments move to their respective stations. Marduk and his whole generation of divinities were but particles of her substance. From the standpoint of those created forms all seemed accomplished as by a mighty arm, amid danger and pain. But from the center of the emanating presence, the flesh was yielded willingly, and the hand that carved it was ultimately no more than an agent of the will of the victim herself.</p>
<p class="calibre15">Herein lies the basic paradox of myth: the paradox of the dual focus. Just as at the opening of the cosmogonic cycle it was possible to say “God is not involved,” but at the same time “God is creator-preserver-destroyer,” so now at this critical juncture, where the One breaks into the many, destiny “happens,” but at the same time “is brought about.” From the perspective of the source, the world is a majestic harmony of forms pouring into being, exploding, and dissolving. But what the swiftly passing creatures experience is a terrible cacaphony of battle cries and pain. The myths do not deny this agony (the crucifixion); they reveal within, behind, and around it essential peace (the heavenly rose).<a id="filepos585233" href="dummy_split_419.html#filepos1063968" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">50</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre15">The shift of perspective from the repose of the central Cause to the turbulation of the peripheral effects is represented in the Fall of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. They ate of the forbidden fruit, “And the eves of them both were opened.”<a id="filepos585648" href="dummy_split_420.html#filepos1064241" class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre18"><span class="calibre7">51</span></sup></a> The bliss of Paradise was closed to them and they beheld the created field from the other side of a transforming veil. Henceforth they should experience the inevitable as the hard to gain.</p>
