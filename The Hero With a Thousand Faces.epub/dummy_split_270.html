Thus they gain each other. In this form he gains yonder world, in that form he experiences this world” <em class="calibre16">(Aitareya Aranyaka</em>, 2. 3. 7). It is known also to the mystics of Islam: “Thirty years the transcendent God was my mirror, now I am my own mirror; i.e., that which I was I am no more, the transcendent God is his own mirror. I say that I am my own mirror; for ‘tis God that speaks with my tongue, and I have vanished” (Bayazid, as cited in <em class="calibre16">The Legacy of Islam</em>, T. W. Arnold and A. Guillaume, editors, Oxford Press, 1931, p. 216).</p></blockquote>
