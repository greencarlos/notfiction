Stooping over the two boys they opened veins in each. Out flowed the blood, and the other men all raised a death cry. The boys were lifeless. The old <em class="calibre16">xuirreenuns</em> (medicine men), dipping their stone knives in the blood, touched with them the lips of all present…. The bodies of the Boorah victims were cooked. Each man who had been to five Boorahs ate a piece of this flesh; no others were allowed to see this done” (K. Langloh Parker. <em class="calibre16">The Euahlayi Tribe</em>, 1905, pp. 72-73; cited by Róheim, <em class="calibre16">The Eternal Ones of the Dream</em>, p. 232).</p></blockquote>
