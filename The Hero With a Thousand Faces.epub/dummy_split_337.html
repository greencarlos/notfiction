<blockquote class="calibre25"><p id="filepos1029580" class="calibre22"><a href="dummy_split_026.html#filepos432761" class="calibre17">14</a> Shinto, “The Way of the Gods,” the tradition native to the Japanese as distinguished from the imported Butsudo, or “Way of the Buddha,” is a way of devotion to the guardians of life and custom (local spirits, ancestral powers, heroes, the divine king, one’s living parents, and one’s living children) as distinguished from the powers that yield release from the round (Bodhisattrvas and Buddhas). The way of worship is primarily that of preserving and cultivating purity of heart: “What is ablution? It is not merely cleansing the body with holy water, but following the Right and Moral Way” (Tomobe-no-Yasutaka, <em class="calibre16">Shinto-Shoden-Kuju)</em>. “What pleases the Deity is virtue and sincerity, not any number of material offerings” <em class="calibre16">(Shinto-Gobusho)</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p class="calibre15">Amaterasu, ancestress of the Royal House, is the chief divinity of the numerous folk pantheon, yet herself only the highest manifestation of the unseen, transcendent yet immanent, Universal God: “The Eight Hundred Myriads of Gods are but differing manifestations of one unique Deity, Kuni-tokotachi-no-Kami, The Eternally Standing Divine Being of the Earth, The Great Unity of All Things in the Universe, The Primordial Being of Heaven and Earth, eternally existing from the beginning to the end of the world” (Izawa-Nagahide, <em class="calibre16">Shinto-Ameno-Nuboko-no-Ki)</em>. “What deity does Amaterasu worship in abstinence in the Plain of High Heaven? She worships her own Self within as a Deity, endeavoring to cultivate divine virtue in her own person by means of inner purity and thus becoming one with the Deity” (Ichijo-Kaneyoshi, <em class="calibre16">Nihonshoki-Sanso)</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre15">Since the Deity is immanent in all things, all things are to be regarded as divine, from the pots and pans of the kitchen to the Mikado: this is Shinto, “The Way of the Gods.” The Mikado being in the highest position receives the greatest reverence, but not reverence different in kind from that bestowed upon all things. “The awe-inspiring Deity manifests Itself, even in the single leaf of a tree or a delicate blade of grass” (Urabe-no-Kanekuni). The function of reverence in Shinto is to honor that Deity in all things; the function of purity to sustain Its manifestation in oneself—following the august model of the divine self-worship of the goddess Amaterasu. “With the unseen God who seeth all secret things in the silence, the heart of the man sincere communes from the earth below” (from a poem by the Emperor Meiji).—All of the quotations above will be found in Genchi Kato, <em class="calibre16">What is Shinto?</em> (Tokyo: Maruzen Company Ltd., 1935); see also Lafcadio Hearn, <em class="calibre16">Japan, An Interpretation</em> (New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1904).</p>
