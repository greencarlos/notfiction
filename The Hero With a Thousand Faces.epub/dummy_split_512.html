<blockquote class="calibre25"><p id="filepos1100892" class="calibre22"><a href="dummy_split_005.html#filepos45239" class="calibre17">18</a> “Forms or images of a collective nature which occur practically all over the earth as constituents of myths and at the same time as autochthonous, individual products of unconscious origin” (C. G. Jung, <em class="calibre16">Psychology</em>
<em class="calibre16">and Religion</em> [Collected Works, vol. 11; New York and London, 1958], par. 88. Orig. written in English 1937. See also his <em class="calibre16">Psychological Types</em>, index.)</p></blockquote>
<p class="calibre15">As Dr. Jung points out <em class="calibre16">(Psychology and Religion</em>, par. 89), the theory of the archetypes is by no means his own invention. Compare Nietzsche:</p>
<p class="calibre15">“In our sleep and in our dreams we pass through the whole thought of earlier humanity. I mean, in the same way that man reasons in his dreams, he reasoned when in the waking state many thousands of years…. The dream carries us back into earlier states of human culture, and affords us a means of understanding it better” (Friedrich Nietzsche, <em class="calibre16">Human</em>
<em class="calibre16">all</em>
<em class="calibre16">too Human</em>, Vol. I, 13; cited by Jung, <em class="calibre16">Psychology and Religion</em>, par. 89, n. 17).</p>
<p class="calibre15">Compare Adolf Bastian’s theory of the ethnic “Elementary Ideas,” which, in their primal psychic character (corresponding to the Stoic <em class="calibre16">Logoi sper-matikoi)</em>, should be regarded as “the spiritual (or psychic) germinal dispositions out of which the whole social structure has been developed organically,” and, as such, should serve as bases of inductive research <em class="calibre16">(Ethnische Elementargedanken in der Lehre vom Menchen</em>, Berlin, 1895, Vol. I, p. ix).</p>
<p class="calibre15">Compare Franz Boas: “Since Waitz’s thorough discussion of the question of the unity of the human species, there can be no doubt that in the main the mental characteristics of man are the same all over the world” <em class="calibre16">(The Mind of Primitive Man</em>, p. 104. Copyright, 1911 by The Macmillan Company and used with their permission). “Bastian was led to speak of the appalling monotony of the fundamental ideas of mankind all over the globe” <em class="calibre16">(ibid.</em>, p. j55). “Certain patterns of associated ideas may be recognized in all types of culture” <em class="calibre16">(ibid.</em>, p. 228).</p>
<p class="calibre15">Compare Sir James G. Frazer: “We need not, with some enquirers in ancient and modern times, suppose that the Western peoples borrowed from the older civilization of the Orient the conception of the Dying and Reviving God, together with the solemn ritual, in which that conception was dramatically set forth before the eyes of the worshippers. More probably the resemblance which may be traced in this respect between the religions of the East and West is no more than what we commonly, though incorrectly, call a fortuitous coincidence, the effect of similar causes acting alike on the similar constitution of the human mind in different countries and under different skies “ <em class="calibre16">(The Golden Bough</em>, one-volume edition, p. 386. Copyright, 1922 by The Macmillan Company and used with their permission).</p>
<p class="calibre15">Compare Sigmund Freud: “I recognized the presence of symbolism in dreams from the very beginning. But it was only by degrees and as my experience increased that I arrived at a full appreciation of its extent and significance, and I did so under the influence of … Wilhelm Stekel…. Stekel arrived at his interpretations of symbols by way of intuition, thanks to a peculiar gift for the direct understanding of them…. Advances in psycho-analytic experience have brought to our notice patients who have shown a direct understanding of dream-symbolism of this kind to a surprising extent…. This symbolism is not peculiar to dreams, but is characteristic of unconscious ideation, in particular among the people, and it is to be found in folklore, and in popular myths, legends, linguistic idioms, proverbial wisdom and current jokes, to a more complete extent than in dreams.” <em class="calibre16">(The Interpretation of Dreams</em>, translated by James Strachey, Standard Edition, V, pp. 350-351.)</p>
<p class="calibre15">Dr. Jung points out that he has borrowed his term <em class="calibre16">archetype</em> from classic sources: Cicero, Pliny, the <em class="calibre16">Corpus Hermeticum</em>, Augustine, etc. <em class="calibre16">(Psychology and Religion</em>, par. 89). Bastian notes the correspondence of his own theory of “Elementary Ideas” with the Stoic concept of the <em class="calibre16">Logoi spermatikoi</em>. The tradition of the “subjectively known forms” (Sanskrit: <em class="calibre16">antarjñeya-rüpa)</em> is, in fact, coextensive with the tradition of myth, and is the key to the understanding and use of mythological images—as will appear abundantly in the following chapters.</p>
