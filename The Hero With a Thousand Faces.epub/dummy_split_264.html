<blockquote class="calibre25"><p id="filepos994629" class="calibre22"><a href="dummy_split_021.html#filepos327949" class="calibre17">109</a> Dr. Karl Menninger has pointed out <em class="calibre16">(op. cit.</em>, pp. 195 196) that though Jewish rabbis, Protestant ministers, and Catholic priests can sometimes be brought to reconcile, on a broad basis, their theoretical differences, yet whenever they begin to describe the rules and regulations by which eternal life is to be achieved, they hopelessly differ. “Up to this point the program is impeccable,” writes Dr. Menninger. “But if no one knows for certain what the rules and regulations are, it all becomes an absurdity.” The reply to this, of course, is that given by Ramakrishna: “God has made different religions to suit different aspirants, times, and countries. All doctrines are only so many paths; but a path is by no means God Himself. Indeed, one can reach God if one follows any of the paths with whole hearted devotion…. One may eat a cake with icing either straight or sidewise. It will taste sweet either way” <em class="calibre16">(The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna</em>, New York, 1941, P- 559).</p></blockquote>
