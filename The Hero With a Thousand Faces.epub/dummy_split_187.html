<blockquote class="calibre25"><p id="filepos962746" class="calibre22"><a href="dummy_split_018.html#filepos230023" class="calibre17">32</a> The sacred writings (Shastras) of Hinduism are divided into four classes: (1) Shruti, which are regarded as direct divine revelation; these include the four Vedas (ancient books of psalms) and certain of the Upanishads (ancient books of philosophy); (2) Smriti, which include the traditional teachings of the orthodox sages, canonical instructions for domestic ceremonials, and certain works of secular and religious law; (3) Purana, which are the Hindu mythological and epic works par exoellence; these treat of cosmogonie, theological, astronomical, and physical knowledge; and (4) Tantra, texts describing techniques and rituals for the worship of deities, and for the attainment of supranormal power. Among the Tantras are a group of particularly important scriptures (called Agamas) which are supposed to have been revealed directly by the Universal God Shiva and his Goddess Parvati. (They are termed, therefore, “The Fifth Veda.”) These support a mystical tradition known specifically as “The Tantra,” which has exercised a pervasive influence on the later forms of Hindu and Buddhist iconography. Tantric symbolism was carried by medieval Buddhism out of India into Tibet, China, and Japan.</p></blockquote>
